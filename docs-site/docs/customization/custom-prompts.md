# Creating Custom Prompts

aibox generates Starship prompt configurations from the selected preset and theme. You can customize the prompt by editing the generated config.

## Generated Config Location

After `aibox sync`, the Starship config is at:

```
.aibox-home/.config/starship.toml
```

## Manual Customization

Edit `.aibox-home/.config/starship.toml` directly with any valid [Starship configuration](https://starship.rs/config/). Changes take effect immediately in new shell sessions.

:::warning Sync overwrites
`aibox sync` regenerates `starship.toml` from the preset and theme. To preserve manual edits, either avoid running sync or back up your config first.
:::

## Adding Custom Presets

Custom presets can be added to `cli/src/themes.rs` in the `starship_config()` function. Each preset is a Starship TOML template with color variables (`{bg}`, `{fg}`, `{accent}`, `{green}`) that are replaced with theme-specific values at generation time.

See the existing presets (default, plain, minimal, nerd-font, pastel, bracketed) as reference patterns.
