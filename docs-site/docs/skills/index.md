# Skills

As of aibox **v0.16.0**, skills are no longer bundled with aibox. They live in
**[processkit](https://github.com/projectious-work/processkit)** — a separate,
versioned content repository that ships skills, primitives, processes, packages,
and the canonical `AGENTS.md` template.

aibox owns the **container** (devcontainers, addons, the CLI, the install/sync
machinery). processkit owns the **content** (skills, packages, processes,
state machines). The boundary is deliberate and load-bearing: it lets the two
projects move at their own velocity without dragging each other through breaking
changes.

## Where skills land in your project

After running `aibox init` and `aibox sync` in your project, processkit content
is materialised under your `context/` directory:

```
context/
├── skills/                          # Active, editable skill copies
└── templates/
    └── processkit/
        └── v0.6.0/                  # Immutable upstream snapshot, git-tracked
            ├── skills/
            ├── packages/
            ├── primitives/
            ├── processes/
            └── scaffolding/
                └── AGENTS.md
```

The version in the path (`v0.6.0`) is whatever you pinned in `aibox.toml`:

```toml
[processkit]
source  = "https://github.com/projectious-work/processkit.git"
version = "v0.6.0"
```

The `context/skills/` copies are yours to edit. The `context/templates/processkit/<version>/`
copies are the immutable upstream snapshot — `aibox sync` uses them as the base
side of a three-way diff to detect upstream changes that should be pulled into
your local edits.

## Skill catalogue and documentation

> **processkit documentation** is not yet deployed as a standalone site.
> Until then, browse the upstream source directly:
>
> - **GitHub:** https://github.com/projectious-work/processkit/tree/main/src/skills
> - **Releases:** https://github.com/projectious-work/processkit/releases
> - **In your project, after `aibox sync`:** `context/skills/` and
>   `context/templates/processkit/<version>/skills/`

Every skill is a directory with at least a `SKILL.md` (the agent-readable
instructions) and may include `references/`, `mcp/`, `assets/`, and `scripts/`
siblings. Skills follow the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Browsing installed skills

```bash
aibox kit skill list               # list installed skills, grouped by category
aibox kit skill list --all         # include available-but-not-installed skills
aibox kit skill list --category ai # filter by category
aibox kit skill info <name>        # frontmatter + description for one skill
aibox kit skill categories         # skill count per category
```

## Packages

processkit ships five packages (`minimal`, `managed`, `software`, `research`,
`product`) that compose skill sets. Select the one that fits your project in
`aibox.toml`:

```toml
[context]
packages = ["managed"]   # or ["software"], ["research"], ["product"], ["minimal"]
```

For the full package definitions and their exact skill composition, see:
- `context/templates/processkit/<version>/packages/` (after `aibox sync`)
- https://github.com/projectious-work/processkit/tree/main/src/packages

## Custom skills

To add a project-specific skill, drop a directory under `context/skills/`:

```
context/skills/my-custom-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

Local skills are not touched by `aibox sync`. They are also not part of any
processkit package — they exist purely for the local project.

## Core skills

Some processkit skills carry `metadata.processkit.core: true` in their
frontmatter (e.g. `skill-finder`). Core skills are installed regardless of any
`[skills].include` / `[skills].exclude` configuration. `aibox doctor` warns if
you attempt to exclude a core skill.

## Why this split?

- **Independent release cadence.** processkit can ship a new skill or fix a
  prompt without forcing an aibox CLI release.
- **Reusable content.** Other tools can consume processkit directly without
  taking a dependency on aibox or its container stack.
- **Forkable content.** A team can fork processkit, point `[processkit].source`
  at the fork, and ship a private skill catalogue without forking aibox itself.
- **Smaller aibox.** The aibox binary stays focused on container lifecycle and
  the install/diff/migrate machinery.

See [`[processkit]` configuration](../reference/configuration.md#processkit) for
the full set of fields, including release-asset URL templates and SHA256
verification.
