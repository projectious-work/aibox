## How compatibility is enforced

In processkit mode, `aibox apply` compares the `[processkit].version` in your
`aibox.toml` against the minimum required version for the running aibox binary.
If the pinned processkit version is older than the minimum, a warning is
emitted:

```
Warning: processkit v0.24.0 is below the minimum recommended version v0.25.0 for aibox v0.23.0 ...
```

This is a warning, not an error — older processkit versions can still install
successfully when their layout is still supported. The warning is a nudge to
upgrade, not a blocker. Harness-only projects do not install processkit content,
so this matrix only matters when `[context].mode = "processkit"`.

## Upgrading processkit

To upgrade processkit in an existing project:

1. Edit `aibox.toml`:
   ```toml
   [processkit]
   version = "v0.25.5"
   ```

2. Run `aibox apply` on the host — the 3-way diff will show changed content
   and generate processkit content migration documents in `context/migrations/pending/`.

3. Review and apply the pending migrations.
