# Runtime Operations

The generated devcontainer is standard Compose output, but the normal workflow
should go through aibox so generated files, runtime home state, and diagnostics
stay aligned.

## Start and Attach

```bash
aibox up
aibox up --layout focus
aibox up --apply
```

`aibox up` creates or starts the container and attaches through tmux. Use
`--layout` for a one-session layout override. Use `--apply` when you want aibox
to reconcile configuration before starting.

## Stop or Remove

```bash
aibox down
aibox delete runtime
```

`down` stops the Compose project. `delete runtime` removes the container while
preserving project files and `.aibox-home/`.

## Rebuild

```bash
aibox apply
aibox apply --no-cache
aibox apply --config-only
```

Use `--no-cache` after base-image, addon, or package-cache issues. `--rebuild`
is kept as a visible alias for the same behavior. Use `--config-only` when you
only want to regenerate files, and in processkit mode refresh processkit
content, without building the image. In harness-only projects,
`--config-only` regenerates config/runtime surfaces without processkit content
work.

## Inspect Runtime State

```bash
aibox get runtime
aibox get runtime --resources
aibox get runtime --resources -o json
aibox describe runtime
```

The resource snapshot is designed for low-dependency environments. It reads
cgroupfs and procfs directly instead of relying on tools such as `ps` or `free`
being installed.

Key fields:

| Field | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_current_bytes` | current cgroup memory usage |
| `memory_max` | memory limit or `unlimited` |
| `oom_kill_count` | whether the kernel has killed a process in the cgroup |
| `total_process_count` | total visible processes |
| `processkit_mcp_python_process_count` | live Python processkit MCP server processes |

An `oom_kill_count` above zero is strong evidence that a missing agent or
terminated tool was killed by the operating system rather than by the CLI.

With current processkit releases, `[ai.mcp.gateway].mode = "auto"` registers a
`processkit-gateway` stdio proxy for MCP-capable harnesses. The proxy starts the
local gateway on demand when no listener exists, so generated devcontainer
startup no longer has to supervise one Python process per skill in the default mode.
Use `separate` only when a harness needs the older one-server-per-skill layout.
Harness-only projects do not register the processkit gateway.

## Resource Thresholds

Configure warning thresholds in `aibox.toml`:

```toml
[container.resource_thresholds]
memory_mib_warn = 4096
process_count_warn = 400
processkit_mcp_python_warn = 50
```

`aibox doctor` uses these values when reporting runtime pressure.

## Compose Identity

Generated Compose output includes:

- a top-level project name derived from `[container].name`
- an explicit image name
- a main service named after the project
- `container_name = [container].name`
- `init: true` for PID 1 process reaping

This keeps Docker Desktop, OrbStack, and Compose UIs from grouping unrelated
aibox projects under a generic `devcontainer` identity.

## Existing Containers After Generator Changes

`aibox apply` rewrites generated files, but it does not magically replace a
running container that was created from older Compose output. Recreate the
runtime when a change affects process model, mounts, image labels, init
behavior, or service identity:

```bash
aibox down
aibox apply
aibox up
```

If a container has already accumulated zombie processes, the fix is still a
runtime recreate. A new generated `init: true` service can reap future orphaned
children, but it cannot change PID 1 in an already-created container.

## Common Symptoms

| Symptom | First checks |
| --- | --- |
| AI process disappears | `aibox get runtime --resources`, then inspect `oom_kill_count` |
| OrbStack groups projects oddly | rerun `aibox apply`, then recreate the container |
| Network drops after idle time | set `[container] keepalive = true` |
| Build keeps using stale layers | run `aibox apply --no-cache` |
| Runtime starts but tools are missing | check selected addons with `aibox describe workspace-manifest` |

## Podman Notes

Podman support depends on the Compose provider behind `podman compose`.
Generated files follow the Compose Specification, including `init: true`.
If an older provider rejects a spec key, upgrade the provider instead of
removing the generated setting.
