# Continue CLI

[Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) is an open-source, provider-agnostic coding agent CLI. Designed for headless environments and containers (Apache 2.0).

## Setup

```toml
[ai]
harnesses = [
  { harness = "continue", enable = true, install = true },
]
```

Run `aibox apply`, then inside the container:

```bash
cn          # Interactive mode
cn -p "..."  # Headless/non-interactive mode (great for scripts and CI)
```

Note: the binary is `cn`, not `continue`.

## API Key

Continue is provider-agnostic — configure the LLM you want to use:

```toml
[container.environment]
CONTINUE_API_KEY = "..."   # Generic key for headless use
# Or provider-specific:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
# OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
```

## Configuration

Continue's configuration is persisted in `.aibox-home/.continue/`, mounted at `/home/aibox/.continue/`.

## MCP Integration

Continue has a native MCP client with a per-server file model. aibox generates files in `.continue/mcpServers/` (one file per server) automatically on `aibox apply`, merging processkit built-in servers in processkit mode, team servers from `aibox.toml [ai.mcp]`, and personal servers from `.aibox-local.toml [mcp]`.

`.continue/mcpServers/` is **gitignored** — it is regenerated on every `aibox apply` and must not be committed.

To add MCP servers:

```toml
# aibox.toml — team-shared servers
[[ai.mcp.servers]]
name    = "github"
command = "npx"
args    = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]

# .aibox-local.toml — personal servers
[[mcp.servers]]
name    = "my-internal-tool"
command = "npx"
args    = ["-y", "@acme/internal-mcp-server"]
```

## Installation

Continue CLI is installed via npm (`npm install -g @continuedev/cli`).
