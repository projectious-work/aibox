The v0.35.0 minor release expands both the visual identity of the terminal and
the reproducible graphics toolchain available to documentation projects.

Borland, Norton, and Phosphor join the theme catalog with period-authentic
Classic variants and accessibility-oriented Optimized variants. All six
palettes propagate through tmux, Yazi, Vim, Bat, Lazygit, Starship, and the
generated theme gallery.

Three new opt-in addons support static graphics during Hugo and other site
builds. `diagramming` provides checksum-verified D2 and Graphviz;
`data-visualization` provides pinned Vega and Vega-Lite command-line tools; and
`mermaid` provides the Mermaid CLI with a pinned Puppeteer browser runtime.
Node and browser-heavy dependencies remain isolated from projects that do not
select them.
