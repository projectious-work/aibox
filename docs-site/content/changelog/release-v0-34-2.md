The v0.34.2 release adds a first-class theme overview, interactive chooser, and
tool-support reference generated from the same correction data used to scaffold
managed theme files. Terminal previews now reflect the actual tmux, editor, and
tool colors, including corrected Contrast-family foregrounds and active-pane
indicators.

This patch also makes Codex completion notifications reliably replace a stale
question marker with working or done state, preserves project-local Codex
notification commands, strengthens the active tmux pane containing Yazi, and
avoids Vim errors from unsupported `dim` attributes.
