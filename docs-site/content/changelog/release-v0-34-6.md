The v0.34.6 patch restores host runtime image builds after PowerKit added a
ninth legitimate escaped conditional color attribute. The aibox compatibility
patch now validates the renderer's actual format contract instead of assuming
a global occurrence count.

The separator color and inherited-style protections introduced in v0.34.5
remain enforced.
