  summary: "Session handover \u2014 aibox v0.23.10 release completed end-to-end"
  actor: codex
  subject: aibox v0.23.10
  subject_kind: Release
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-04'
    current_state: aibox v0.23.10 is released end-to-end. The repo integrated processkit v0.25.7, added apply-time aibox.toml structure migration, exposed image-slimming controls through addon tools, refreshed generated config comments, finalized generated-runtime release handling, and closed the Linux-side release through scripts/maintain.sh release 0.23.10. The user then completed host-side Phase 2; GitHub release assets now include both Linux and both macOS tarballs. main is clean and synced at post-release generated-runtime commit 82b2c84, while tag v0.23.10 points at d5451be as created by the release script.
    open_threads:
    - GHCR package metadata was not independently verified from this container because the current gh token lacks read:packages scope and GitHub returned 403. The user reported host-side Phase 2 done, so treat image push as complete unless there is downstream evidence to the contrary.
    - 'main contains post-tag commit 82b2c84 chore: refresh generated runtime for v0.23.10. This is expected from host-side release-finalize-runtime and is already pushed to origin/main; do not confuse it with an untagged CLI release change.'
    - No pending or in-progress processkit migrations were present before release prep; the v0.25.7 migration MIG-20260504T144457 was applied with no conflicts.
    - No in-progress or blocked WorkItems were returned by query_workitems during wrapup.
    next_recommended_action: If the next session starts with release verification, first confirm GHCR v0.23.10 image tags from a token with read:packages scope or from the host environment; otherwise continue normal development from clean origin/main at 82b2c84.

    - CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 RUSTFLAGS='-C debuginfo=0' cargo test --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml -j1
    - CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 RUSTFLAGS='-C debuginfo=0' cargo clippy --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
    - git diff --check
    - scripts/maintain.sh release 0.23.10 ran format check, clippy, unit tests, E2E tier 1, integration tests, cargo audit, Linux release builds, version smoke test, tag push, GitHub release creation, and docs deploy
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - The work followed the canonical release workflow and separately pushed main after the release script, matching the repo-specific gotcha that the script pushes tags/docs but not main.
    - The processkit v0.25.7 migration was inspected and applied through migration management rather than hand-editing generated processkit content.
    - GHCR verification could not be completed in-container due missing read:packages token scope; this caveat is recorded rather than silently assuming API verification succeeded.
