  summary: "Session handover \u2014 aibox v0.25.9 released with processkit v0.26.1 and host-side completion verified"
  actor: TEAMMEMBER-20260508_2042-MigratedMember-avery
  subject: aibox v0.25.9 release
  subject_kind: Release
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-12'
    current_state: 'aibox v0.25.9 is released. The release includes processkit v0.26.1, applied processkit/runtime migrations, list-based tmux status work, Yazi OMP removal, runtime fixes, and the generated runtime refresh from host Phase 2. Linux-side and host-side release steps are complete: GitHub release assets for Linux and macOS are uploaded, GHCR images were pushed by the host step, runtime smoke passed, docs were deployed, and origin/main is clean at b993e50dcc08eb79c789715179ccaf8cdfb7da33.'
    open_threads:
    - No WorkItems are currently indexed as in_progress or blocked. The indexed WorkItem states show 5 items in review, including v0.25.6 CI/code-quality followups, security-hardening followups, stale-process/v1 cleanup, tmux runtime redesign, and tmux visual E2E rewrite.
    - The processkit MCP query_workitems/query_entities calls returned an Unexpected response type during wrapup; the same index data was read from context/.cache/processkit/index.sqlite as a fallback. Next session should consider diagnosing the gateway response shape if this repeats.
    - Host-side release reported runtime smoke passed with logs in dist/release-smoke/v0.25.9/. Those logs were not re-opened during wrapup because the user already reported host completion and GitHub/local verification passed.
    next_recommended_action: Run a short post-release verification from a derived project against v0.25.9, especially `aibox apply --standardize-config` and the tmux/Yazi status surfaces that were changed, then close or update the five WorkItems currently in review if the release evidence is sufficient.
    branch: main
    commit: b993e50
    working_tree: clean; main and origin/main both at b993e50dcc08eb79c789715179ccaf8cdfb7da33
    stash: none
    release_url: https://github.com/projectious-work/aibox/releases/tag/v0.25.9
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - No deferred entity creation was left outstanding. The release was committed, pushed, tagged, and verified before wrapup.
    - 'A tool-quality gap appeared: WorkItem query MCP calls failed with Unexpected response type. This was captured as an open thread rather than silently ignored.'
    - The final host-generated runtime refresh commit initially remained local; it was detected and pushed to origin/main before handover.
