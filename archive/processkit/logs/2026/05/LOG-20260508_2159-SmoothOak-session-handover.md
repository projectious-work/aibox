  summary: "Session handover \u2014 v0.25.6: 10 implementation tracks shipped, 67 GB disk reclaimed, team grown to 5 AI agents; only the human-gated R3+R5 release cutover steps remain."
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-08'
    current_state: "v0.25.6 is **content-complete on `main`** at commit `20ad842`. All 10\nimplementation tracks shipped this session; the only outstanding work\nis the two human-gated release-cutover steps (R3 baseline refresh and\nR5 tag/build/publish), tracked as the `review`-state WorkItem\n`BACK-20260508_1519-PluckyThorn`.\n\nTests are green (830 unit + 90 e2e + 28 integration = 948; 1 ignored\nDocker companion). Working tree is clean \u2014 last uncommitted item is\nthis handover itself plus the team active-interlocutor switch.\n\nWorkspace disk pressure was relieved this session: 95% \u2192 87% used,\n~67 GB reclaimed (cli/target/ rebuilt-on-demand, old dist tarballs,\ndocs-site/node_modules, __pycache__, /tmp orphans). **Side effect:**\nnext `cargo test` will rebuild from cold (~5\u201315 min). `.aibox-home/.cache/`\nand `/tmp/aibox/uv-cache` were intentionally left untouched (live\nsession mounts).\n\nTeam grew from 2 (Cora + Bernhard) to 6 (5 AI agents + 1 human) under\n`DEC-20260508_2136-WildPanda`:\
      \ Avery (SE/senior), Robin (SE/junior),\nJordan (technical-writer/senior), Sage (CTO/principal), plus existing\nCora (PM/senior) and Bernhard (CEO/principal). All five AI agents\nhave role-shaped personalities and explicit dispatch boundaries.\n"
    open_threads:
    - "PluckyThorn R3 + R5 \u2014 release cutover steps for v0.25.6 (in review state, human-gated)."
    - "LuckyLily Q3 missed the < 2,400 line target on seed.rs (achieved 2,929; -684 from 3,613). Further split possible \u2014 cleanup helpers, addon plumbing, harness state could each go into their own modules. Filed as a follow-up to consider for v0.25.7."
    - "BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 6 (Variant 3 Migration emission for drifted-but-possibly-intentional files) deferred from this session \u2014 not blocking v0.25.6 but completes the cleanup-arch epic."
    - "LuckyLily Q2 \u2014 `aibox skills add/remove` CLI surface. Optional follow-up; not in v0.25.6."
    - "LuckyLily Q5 \u2014 release-runtime-smoke status diff in CI. Worth doing before v0.25.7 ships."
    - "LuckyLily Q7 \u2014 fact-check inline comments on the `[skills]` block in aibox.toml after Q1's dedup. Non-urgent."
    - "Two pre-existing review-state WorkItems from 2026-05-07: CalmBison (BACK-20260507_1455 tmux runtime redesign epic) and CalmRabbit (BACK-20260507_1456 visual e2e rewrite). Not touched this session \u2014 verify whether they are actually still 'in review' or just unaccepted."
    - "Hermes (Nous Research) and OpenCode (opencode.ai) addons pinned to GitHub release URLs without checksum verification \u2014 vendors don't publish SHA256SUMS. TODO comments are in the yaml; revisit when vendors add signatures."
    - AWS GPG verification fetches the AWS CLI public key at build time from `hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com`. Stricter posture would bundle the key as a repo file. Decide on next security review.
    - Existing aibox-derived projects with `[harnesses.codex]` enabled but no `[security]` section will hit a hard error on next `aibox apply` (hard cut per the new `acknowledge_seccomp_unconfined` gate). Mention prominently in v0.25.6 release announcement.
    - 'Three upstream issues open on `projectious-work/processkit`: #18 (signal sentiment), #19 (Claude Code knobs), #20 (catalog vs archetype + codename clarity + consultants concept + person-vs-clone + budget model).'
    next_recommended_action: "**Run R3 (release-runtime-smoke baseline) for v0.25.6, then R5\n(tag/build/publish) \u2014 in that order.**\n\nConcrete steps:\n1. From a clean container with Docker available, run\n   `cd /workspace && scripts/release-runtime-smoke.sh v0.25.6`.\n   Verify the run succeeds end-to-end. Commit the resulting\n   `dist/release-smoke/v0.25.6/` directory (it's expected to be a\n   small set of `.txt` and `.log` baseline files).\n2. Run `scripts/release-check-state.sh` to verify the release\n   pre-flight (tag uniqueness, version bumps, no uncommitted\n   changes).\n3. Tag `v0.25.6` on `main` at the current head (or whatever the\n   release-check-state script tells you). Push the tag.\n4. Run the build pipeline (whatever the project's release script\n   does \u2014 `scripts/release.sh` or equivalent; verify the README /\n   AGENTS.md for the canonical command).\n5. After v0.25.6 is live, transition `BACK-20260508_1519-PluckyThorn`\n   from review \u2192 done with a\
      \ note pointing at the release tag.\n\n**If R3/R5 are deferred to a later session:** there is no urgency \u2014\nv0.25.6 content is on `main` and will sit there safely. Just remember\nto surface PluckyThorn at the top of the next briefing.\n"

    commit: 20ad842
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - "**Misread 'use the team' as 'use Claude Code's generic Agent tool'.** Initial dispatch of 2 parallel agents went under `general-purpose` subagent_type rather than via team-resolved bindings. Recovery: queried `list_team_members`, surfaced the engineering gap, added Avery, switched to team-attributed dispatch with `model:` overrides matching role tier. Encoded by filing processkit issue #18 (signal sentiment \u2014 positive imperatives outperform negative ones in compliance contracts) and #19 (Claude Code-specific harness knobs)."
    - '**Asserted ''no active interlocutor configured'' in the briefing without calling `get_active_interlocutor`.** Cora was actually configured since 2026-05-03. The pk-resume skill''s gotcha section explicitly warned about this. Encoded by filing processkit issue #18 with this exact case as repro.'
    - "**Treated Avery as cloneable role-definition rather than a single person.** Dispatched 2 parallel agents under TEAMMEMBER-20260508_2042-MigratedMember-avery's identity (HonestAnt + KeenBison ran simultaneously). User correctly flagged this as awkward for human reasoning. Encoded by filing processkit issue #20 (gap 4 \u2014 person-vs-clone-instance ambiguity in TeamMember model)."
    - "**Initial WorkItem state was out of sync with shipped commits at session start.** Five v0.25.6 tracks were already in commits but still in `backlog` state. Reconciled this session. Future tracks dispatched in same session keep state synchronized \u2014 but this is fragile if a future session lands code without transitioning. Worth a `pk-doctor` rule that flags 'commits reference closed-style markers (BR-X, item N) but the matching WorkItem is still in backlog' \u2014 filed as a candidate follow-up for v0.25.7 doctor work."
    - '**`suggest_name` does not dedupe across calls in a single session.** Pulled Jordan three times in a row when asking for three distinct neutral names. Workaround: `list_available_names` and pick deliberately. Worth a `kind=neutral, exclude=already-suggested-this-call` flag in the API. Surfacing as a passing comment in processkit issue #20 (low priority).'
    - "**Agent self-reported test counts diverged from reality.** QuietCedar agent reported '90 unit + 28 integration = 118 total' \u2014 was actually 830+90+28=948. The agent's `cargo test` output likely truncated. Mitigation already in place: I always re-run the suite after each track lands. Reinforces: trust-but-verify on agent reports."
