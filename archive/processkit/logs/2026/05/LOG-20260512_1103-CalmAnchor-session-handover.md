  summary: "Session handover \u2014 aibox v0.25.10 complete and repository clean after handover commit"
  actor: codex
  subject: aibox-v0.25.10-release
  subject_kind: Release
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-12'
    current_state: aibox v0.25.10 is fully released. processkit v0.26.2 is integrated as the default, Linux and macOS release assets are accounted for, GHCR images were pushed by the host phase, docs were deployed, runtime smoke passed, and generated runtime surfaces were refreshed. The leftover aibox.toml generated-comment cleanup and the initial handover LogEntry were committed in 89bb970, leaving the working tree clean before this final handover entry.
    open_threads:
    - processkit release-audit still reports historical live context items as ERROR while pk-doctor reports them as grandfathered INFO; this remains an upstream alignment/thread to track if release-audit is used as a hard gate for aibox dogfood context.
    - The release script skipped opt-in full visual E2E by default; regular visual/runtime/keybinding tests and Tier 2 SSH companion E2E passed.
    - After the next container rebuild, verify the live tmux statusline and PowerKit provider/status plugin behavior in the rebuilt runtime.
    next_recommended_action: 'On next pk-resume, verify the rebuilt container runtime: run pk-doctor/aibox doctor, inspect the live tmux statusline after rebuild, and confirm v0.25.10 install/checksum behavior from the published release.'

    uncommitted_changes: []
    stash: none
    validation:
    - 'pk-doctor clean in release flow: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 pending migrations'
    - cargo fmt passed
    - cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings passed
    - 'cargo test passed: 902 unit, 90 E2E with 1 ignored, 29 integration'
    - 'Tier 2 SSH companion E2E passed: 128 passed, 7 ignored'
    - cargo audit clean
    - GitHub release v0.25.10 verified with Linux binaries and .sha256 sidecars
    - 'User confirmed host-side release steps complete: macOS binaries, GHCR images, runtime smoke, generated runtime refresh'
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - The first release attempt hit the known compat-table hard gate after the version bump. The 0.25.10 compat row was added and amended into the release bump commit before the successful rerun.
    - MCP WorkItem query tools returned 'Unexpected response type' during wrapup, so in-progress/blocked WorkItems could not be enumerated through the intended index-management path in this turn.
    - The first handover entry was written before committing the leftover aibox.toml cleanup; this final handover supersedes it with clean git context.
