    current_state: "Branch main is clean at HEAD c503ff6 (chore: add v0.25.5 session handover). Two prior handovers landed earlier today (LOG-20260508_1311-RoyalBrook, LOG-20260508_1147-KeenMoss) recording the v0.25.5 release end-to-end. The working tree now carries an in-flight v0.25.5\u2192v0.25.4 downgrade: aibox.lock pins cli_version=0.25.4 (synced 2026-05-05), aibox.toml and the three .devcontainer files (Dockerfile, devcontainer.json, docker-compose.yml) are modified, and two new files are untracked: context/migrations/20260508_1520_0.25.5-to-0.25.4.md (the pending migration) and context/templates/aibox-home/0.25.4/.claude.json (templates mirror \u2014 must not be hand-edited). Nothing has been committed in this session \u2014 the agent only invoked /model, /effort, /pk-wrapup and queried state. No in-progress or blocked WorkItems are currently indexed."
    open_threads:
    - "Pending migration context/migrations/20260508_1520_0.25.5-to-0.25.4.md is in 'pending' state and lists owner host actions (run `aibox apply` for v0.25.4, then `aibox build`) \u2014 must be discussed with the owner before any in-container action proceeds; aibox commands run on the host and cannot be executed by the agent."
    - "Uncommitted devcontainer changes (.devcontainer/Dockerfile +20 / devcontainer.json +3 / docker-compose.yml +6) and aibox.toml/aibox.lock edits are staged in the working tree but not committed \u2014 confirm whether these are the intended product of `aibox apply` for v0.25.4 (matches the synced_at 2026-05-05 timestamp in the lock) or stale drift before committing."
    - "Untracked template snapshot context/templates/aibox-home/0.25.4/.claude.json appeared in the working tree; context/templates/ is the read-only upstream mirror per AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md \u2014 the file should be left to the installer/`aibox apply` flow, not hand-edited or hand-committed."
    - "No open WorkItems were returned for in_progress or blocked states \u2014 confirm via `query_workitems` at next session start in case the index needs reindex."
    next_recommended_action: 'Walk the pending migration context/migrations/20260508_1520_0.25.5-to-0.25.4.md with the project owner item by item: confirm whether the v0.25.4 sync already happened on the host (aibox.lock synced_at=2026-05-05 suggests yes) and decide whether the uncommitted .devcontainer/aibox.* changes should be committed as the v0.25.4 downgrade, or reverted because the v0.25.5 release should stand. Do not run `aibox` commands from the container and do not hand-edit context/templates/.'
