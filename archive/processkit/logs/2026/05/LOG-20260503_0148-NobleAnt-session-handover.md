  summary: Session handover - aibox v0.23.0 released and ready for container rebuild
  actor: Codex
  subject: aibox v0.23.0 release shutdown handover
  subject_kind: release
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-03'
    current_state: aibox v0.23.0 is released. Linux-side release completed from the devcontainer, the host-side release was reported done by the user, GitHub Release v0.23.0 has all four binaries attached, docs are deployed, and main plus the v0.23.0 tag both point at commit 14f3369. The working tree was clean before this handover; this handover and one release-process follow-up WorkItem are the only new session-close records.
    open_threads:
    - No WorkItems are currently in-progress or blocked according to processkit queries.
    - Post-release Phase 3/SteadyTiger work remains intentionally deferred until after this release/rebuild; it needs investigation and discussion rather than immediate implementation.
    - GHCR package tags were not verified from the container because the current gh token lacks read:packages; the user reported the host-side release step is done.
    - New follow-up WorkItem BACK-20260503_0148-CalmDew-release-script-notes-push-order records that the release script should prepare curated release notes before GitHub Release creation and push main before or with the tag.
    next_recommended_action: After the container rebuild, run pk-resume, verify the new environment is on aibox 0.23.0, run aibox doctor, and specifically confirm the active container now uses the generated init reaper instead of the old `sleep infinity` PID 1 before continuing to Phase 3 investigation.
    branch: main
    commit: 14f3369
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - The release script created terse auto-generated release notes before I could edit them; the user corrected this, and I replaced the GitHub Release body with comprehensive sectioned notes. Follow-up WorkItem BACK-20260503_0148-CalmDew-release-script-notes-push-order captures the durable fix.
    - The release script pushed the tag before origin/main contained the version-bump commit. I manually pushed main afterward and recorded the same follow-up WorkItem so the script can be improved.
