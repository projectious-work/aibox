  summary: "Session handover \u2014 v0.25.6 plan recorded as DEC + 6 WorkItems; ready for parallel implementation in next session"
  actor: claude-opus-4-7
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-08'
    current_state: "Cross-cutting code & UX review of aibox at /workspace completed. Four parallel investigation agents returned with file:line-cited verdicts on the six reported symptoms. Owner approved the verdict and the per-category cleanup-variant policy. The plan is now recorded as DEC-20260508_1515-SilentAsh-v0-25-6-cross-cutting-cleanup (state: accepted) and six WorkItems (state: backlog) covering all implementation tracks for v0.25.6. All six WorkItems are linked to the decision; blocked_by edges are in place so the dependency graph is queryable. Branch main is still at HEAD c503ff6 (clean commits through v0.25.5). Working tree carries only context/ entity additions plus the unchanged v0.25.5\u2192v0.25.4 downgrade artifacts from earlier sessions; no source code was modified this session. Next session is scoped to begin implementation; the user will rebuild the container first (per their message) so the host CLI matches v0.25.6 work."
    open_threads:
    - 'Implementation tracks ready in backlog (parent: DEC-20260508_1515-SilentAsh): BACK-...BrightStream (cleanup-arch, foundational, blocks all others); BACK-...TrueBrook (zellij excision); BACK-...SnowyWillow (doctor gaps); BACK-...KeenBison (e2e/companion test gaps, blocked_by cleanup-arch + doctor-gaps); BACK-...HonestAnt (security hardening); BACK-...LuckyLily (code quality + aibox.toml dedup + seed.rs split); BACK-...PluckyThorn (release rollout, blocked_by all five above).'
    - 'Per-category cleanup-variant policy is recorded in DEC rationale: Variant 1 hard-purge (managed runtime files, addon binaries when disabled, plugin caches, zellij, legacy processkit-version files); Variant 2 opt-in via [apply].purge_disabled_harness_state (per-harness dirs, addon config dirs, harness MCP configs); Variant 3 migration-note-only (drifted-but-possibly-intentional user customization).'
    - "Lockfile schema must be extended in BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 1 to record previous addon/tool/harness selection \u2014 prerequisite for general purge-on-removal. Backfill plan: auto-Migration on first apply."
    - "Pre-existing v0.25.5\u2192v0.25.4 working-tree drift remains untouched (.devcontainer/* + aibox.lock + aibox.toml + context/migrations/20260508_1520_0.25.5-to-0.25.4.md + context/templates/aibox-home/0.25.4/.claude.json). The earlier handover (LOG-20260508_1338-BraveAnt) flagged this; owner mentioned rebuilding from v0.25.4 explains the runtime-image v0.25.2 mismatch. Decide direction (commit downgrade vs revert and ship v0.25.6 from current source) at the start of implementation."
    - "Pending runtime migration MIG-RUNTIME-20260508T115429 (aibox-runtime-home 0.25.2\u21920.25.4, 7 conflicts) is still in pending/ \u2014 owner has not yet walked it; might be moot once v0.25.6 host CLI is in use, but needs an explicit decision (apply vs reject) before release."
    - 'Owner''s promised next step: rebuild container with v0.25.6 source so implementation can start in a clean environment.'
    - 'Owner explicit constraint: keep heavy inline commenting in aibox.toml [skills] block; only dedup the enabled[]/disabled[] duplication and streamline wrong/outdated comments. Encoded in BR-CODE-QUALITY (BACK-...LuckyLily).'
    next_recommended_action: "Wait for the user's container rebuild to complete, then begin implementation by claiming BACK-20260508_1516-BrightStream-stale-state-cleanup-architecture-foundational (the foundational track that blocks others). Dispatch three parallel general-purpose subagents per its 'Dispatch hint': one for items 1-2 (lockfile schema + cross-version managed-runtime recognizer), one for items 3-5 (purge surfaces across all addons + per-harness state + plugin cache), one for item 6 (Migration emission for drifted-but-possibly-intentional files). Run after item 1 lands, since 3-6 depend on the new lockfile schema. While that work is in flight, BR-ZELLIJ-EXCISE, BR-DOCTOR-GAPS, BR-SEC-HARDEN, and BR-CODE-QUALITY can run in parallel \u2014 they have no internal blockers. BR-TEST-GAPS and BR-RELEASE-ROLLOUT are last (blocked_by graph already in place)."

    behavioral_retrospective:
    - 'Approval handling: when the owner said ''Confirmed'' and gave a multi-paragraph implementation directive, I correctly read it as decision language and recorded a DecisionRecord (DEC-20260508_1515-SilentAsh) plus 6 WorkItems in the same turn, satisfying the contract''s ''commit in same turn'' rule. No deferred entity creation.'
    - 'MCP schema discovery: hit two schema-validation errors during create_workitem (slug_summary word count) and one during record_decision (deciders pattern). Resolved by retrying with valid inputs. Future agents should pre-check slug_summary is 4-6 words and deciders match ^(ACTOR|TEAMMEMBER)-... before calling.'
    - "Team coordination: dispatched 4 parallel general-purpose agents for the review in a single message; all returned strong file:line-cited reports without duplicated work. The pattern (briefing each with concrete starting file paths + scoped acceptance criteria) was efficient \u2014 reuse it for the implementation phase next session."
