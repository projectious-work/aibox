  summary: "Session handover \u2014 aibox v0.25.10 fully released with processkit v0.26.2 integrated"
  actor: codex
  subject: aibox-v0.25.10-release
  subject_kind: Release
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-12'
    current_state: 'processkit v0.26.2 was integrated as the default processkit version. aibox v0.25.10 was released: Linux release assets and checksum sidecars were uploaded, docs deployed, and the user confirmed host-side macOS binaries, GHCR images, runtime smoke, and generated runtime refresh are complete. main is at 595f738, the host-side generated runtime refresh commit. pk-doctor was clean during the release flow: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 pending migrations.'
    open_threads:
    - 'Working tree has a small uncommitted aibox.toml generated-comment cleanup: one container.image comment wording change, removal of stale yazi-omp commented addon block, and a harness-order comment wording change.'
    - processkit release-audit still reports historical live context issues as ERROR even though pk-doctor reports them as grandfathered INFO; this did not block the aibox release path, but the mismatch remains worth upstream alignment.
    - Release script skipped opt-in full visual E2E by default; regular visual/runtime/keybinding tests and Tier 2 SSH companion E2E passed.
    next_recommended_action: Decide whether to commit the small aibox.toml generated-comment cleanup or leave it for the next config-refresh pass, then run pk-resume and verify the live post-rebuild tmux statusline after the user rebuilds the container.
    branch: main
    commit: 595f738
    uncommitted_changes:
    - aibox.toml
    stash: none
    validation:
    - 'pk-doctor clean in release flow: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 pending migrations'
    - cargo fmt passed
    - cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings passed
    - 'cargo test passed: 902 unit, 90 E2E with 1 ignored, 29 integration'
    - 'Tier 2 SSH companion E2E passed: 128 passed, 7 ignored'
    - cargo audit clean
    - GitHub release v0.25.10 verified with Linux binaries and .sha256 sidecars
    - 'User confirmed host-side release steps complete: macOS binaries, GHCR images, runtime smoke, generated runtime refresh'
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - The first release attempt hit the known compat-table hard gate after the version bump. I added the 0.25.10 compat row and amended it into the release bump commit before rerunning the release successfully.
    - MCP WorkItem query tools returned 'Unexpected response type' during wrapup, so open WorkItems could not be enumerated through the intended index-management path in this turn.
