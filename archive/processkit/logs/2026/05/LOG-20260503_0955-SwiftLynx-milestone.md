  summary: Expanded native Zellij status plugin scope to a two-line key-hint and runtime-status plugin target.

    revised_title: Build native Zellij plugin for aibox key hints and runtime status
    target: 'Two-line bottom UI implemented as a native Zellij plugin surface: one key-hint bar and one runtime status bar, each independently showable/hidable.'
    findings:
    - The current aibox Zellij config clears default keybindings and leaves Normal mode with only Ctrl+g, so the built-in status bar only has a sparse Normal-mode map plus shared Alt bindings to show.
    - The aibox leader map currently lives in Zellij tmux mode, which works mechanically but prevents the built-in bar from presenting a curated all-leader-command menu while still in Normal mode.
    - Zellij's plugin API exposes ModeInfo.keybinds grouped by input mode, so a native plugin can render a purpose-built keybar from the real configured bindings rather than hardcoded documentation.
    - The built-in status-bar and compact-bar aliases define row slots but not a configurable grouped key-hint/status composition, so aibox needs its own plugin for the desired combined UX.
    scope:
    - Replace the shell-pane aibox-status workaround with a native Zellij plugin or plugin pair.
    - 'Render a 1-row key-hint bar grouped by task area: pane, tab, view/layout, tools, scroll/search, session.'
    - 'Render a 1-row runtime status bar grouped by system/project area: memory pressure, CPU throttling, process/processkit mode, filesystem, uptime, and project state.'
    - 'Support independent leader-key toggles for key hints and runtime status: show/hide keybar without hiding status, and show/hide status without hiding keybar.'
    - Adapt to terminal width by dropping lower-priority groups before truncating important labels.
    - Avoid layout churn and visual blinking on refresh.
    - Use live Zellij mode/keybinding data where possible, with a stable aibox fallback grouping for leader commands.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - A user can toggle the key-hint bar and status bar independently from the aibox leader key.
    - The key-hint row shows basic Zellij/aibox functions missing from the current sparse built-in bar, including open pane, close pane, split pane, fullscreen, pane navigation, tab navigation, scroll/search, and status toggles.
    - The status row keeps the accepted grouped runtime stats and does not blink during refresh.
    - The implementation does not require parsing or hand-maintaining generated keybinding comments as the primary data source if Zellij ModeInfo is available.
    - The design documents the tradeoff between replacing the built-in zellij:status-bar and running alongside it during migration.
