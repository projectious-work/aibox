  summary: 'Updated handover before OrbStack restart: production containers can show the same process-explosion class as E2E; add automatic runtime logging/post-mortem capture to aibox/processkit.'
  actor: codex
  subject: aibox runtime process explosion triage
  subject_kind: incident
  details:
    reason_for_update: 'User corrected earlier framing: the OrbStack/e2e overload should be treated as a reproducible symptom of a production-relevant runtime failure class, not as test-only.'

      zellij_log_signal: Cannot read SHELL env, falling back to use /bin/sh, repeated about once per minute
    current_assessment:
      production_baseline: The sampled production aibox container was healthy at about 96 PIDs, so runaway is triggered rather than constant.
      not_version_bump: The 0.24.0 bump is not the initial trigger; reported production failures were on 0.23.21.
      suspect_window:
      - v0.23.2 made shell aibox-status substantially heavier
      - v0.23.3 introduced native plugin invoking aibox-status --plugin-json
      - v0.23.4 made native status mode default
      - v0.23.9 revised status behavior again
      leading_hypothesis: Zellij native status plugin periodically invokes the Bash aibox-status collector; the collector scans /proc with subprocess-heavy helpers. If collection stalls or overlaps under startup/permission/Zellij fallback conditions, it can amplify PID pressure and produce the observed high-PID state.
      related_production_bug: SHELL is still missing in the live Zellij parent environment, causing repeated /bin/sh fallback logs; keep the unreleased SHELL=/bin/bash runtime fix.
    release_state:
      release_not_complete: true
      local_head: '6f1d53e chore: bump CLI version to 0.24.0'
      origin_main: 'b93582a fix: harden runtime tui handoffs'
      git_state: main ahead 1; cli/tests/e2e/visual_matrix.rs modified; this handover log untracked before commit
      no_tag_or_release: v0.24.0 was not tagged or published
    must_do_next:
      immediate: User will restart OrbStack; do not run heavy E2E/Docker tests until resumed.
      implementation_priorities:
      - Replace or heavily bound the Bash aibox-status collector path, especially /proc scanning; avoid per-PID cat/tr/awk subprocess fanout.
      - Add an in-flight request guard/backoff in the Zellij status plugin so timer events cannot overlap status collection.
      - Add fast PID-count bailout and degraded-mode rendering when pids.current/process count is above threshold.
      - Preserve SHELL=/bin/bash and cache ownership fixes from current unreleased work.
      - Rework the visual/E2E harness only after runtime collector safety is fixed; the harness can trigger the same class but is not the root production-only boundary.
      automatic_logging_requirement: 'Implement built-in aibox/processkit runtime observability so post-mortem evidence is captured without manual host intervention. Candidate designs: lightweight in-container watchdog process, sidecar container, or integrated aibox runtime supervisor that periodically records pids.current, memory.events, cpu.stat, process state counts by /proc/*/stat+comm, zellij log tail, status-plugin errors, and container/version metadata into a bounded ring buffer under .aibox/ or a mounted diagnostics directory. It must avoid /proc/*/cmdline in high-PID states and must keep overhead bounded.'
    safe_host_probe_for_future_bad_state: 'Use stat+comm only, not /proc/*/cmdline: docker stats; cgroup pids.current and memory.events; for /proc/[0-9] read stat state plus comm; tail zellij logs.'
