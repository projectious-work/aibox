  summary: Session handover - v0.25.5 release completed end to end
  actor: codex
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-08'
    current_state: aibox v0.25.5 is released end to end. Linux-side release completed from the container, main was pushed, tag v0.25.5 was created, GitHub release assets were uploaded, docs were deployed, and the user confirmed host-side release steps completed. Post-confirmation verification showed the release has all four binary assets, runtime smoke artifacts exist under dist/release-smoke/v0.25.5/20260508-150814/, and local main is clean and aligned with origin/main at cdd2f37.
    open_threads:
    - No WorkItems are currently in_progress or blocked.
    - BACK-20260508_1214-SureSeal-review-uv-image-update-after-v0255 remains in backlog to evaluate ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv 0.11.10 -> 0.11.11 after the patch release.
    - BACK-20260508_1214-TallFrog-review-wasm-bindgen-updates remains in backlog to review js-sys and wasm-bindgen lockfile updates after the patch release.
    next_recommended_action: Start the next session by running pk-resume and then decide whether to pick up the two v0.25.5 dependency follow-up WorkItems, beginning with the uv image update because it affects generated runtime/container image behavior.

      - '86b8cc4 fix: refresh tmux runtime before session recreate'
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - The release exposed that the E2E companion image was missing durable Podman/rootless networking tools; this was fixed in .devcontainer/Dockerfile.e2e and validated by full companion E2E.
    - The tmux managed socket migration required aligning visual matrix tests with the managed socket; this was fixed rather than weakening coverage.
    - The vim-loop keep-alive behavior changed visual keybinding assumptions; tests were hardened to wait for real Yazi render state and inspect target-pane command state instead of global process state.
    - 'No deferred promise from this wrapup remains unrecorded: dependency follow-ups already have backlog WorkItems and this handover captures the release state.'
