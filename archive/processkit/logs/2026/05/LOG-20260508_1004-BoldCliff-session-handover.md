  summary: "Session handover \u2014 tmux/Yazi/status/theme/E2E companion fixes are in-flight, live runtime drift is corrected, and next session should recreate the container then run the full patch release."
  actor: TEAMMEMBER-20260422_0832-MigratedMember-cora
  subject: aibox tmux status/runtime drift and e2e companion fixes before patch release
  subject_kind: session
  details:
    session_date: '2026-05-08'
    current_state: The working tree is intentionally dirty with source fixes for tmux attach/Yazi startup, tmux status configuration, PowerKit theme roster support, and E2E companion startup. Live ignored .aibox-home drift was corrected with `AIBOX_ADDONS_DIR=/workspace/addons cargo run --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml -- set theme.mode auto --apply`; `aibox doctor` now reports runtime theme files match the current aibox reference. Non-container validation is green; Tier-2 E2E needs the recreated devcontainer so the companion service is started and resolvable.
    open_threads:
    - BACK-20260507_1455-CalmBison-aibox-v0250-tmux-runtime-redesign remains in-progress.
    - User will recreate the container next. After resume, verify aibox-e2e-testrunner is reachable and run full patch-release validation.
    - Focused Tier-2 E2E still cannot pass in the current already-running container because it lacks docker/podman and the sibling companion is not currently running; the code now starts/includes the companion through compose override paths after recreation.
    - No stashes remain.
    next_recommended_action: After container recreation, run pk-resume, confirm `aibox-e2e-testrunner` resolves/reaches SSH, then execute the full patch release workflow requested by the user.

    - cargo clippy --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings passed.
    - cargo fmt --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml -- --check passed.
    - git diff --check passed.
    - bash -n scripts/maintain.sh passed.
    - 'aibox doctor passed with 3 warnings and 0 errors; remaining warnings are environmental for current container: no docker/podman, Codex hidden app-tool cache, and bubblewrap smoke probe.'
    behavioral_retrospective:
    - I initially described .aibox-home drift as conflicts; the user asked for clarification. The accurate term is doctor drift warnings on ignored live runtime files, not merge conflicts.
    - I corrected the live runtime drift before handover so the recreated container starts from the current generated tmux/theme projection.
