  title: Decide tmux persistence policy for resurrect and continuum
  state: backlog
  type: task
  priority: medium
  description: 'Determine whether tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum are complementary, overlapping, or risky for aibox. Default implementation should install them pinned but keep persistence disabled unless a policy is accepted. Evaluate interaction with host-mounted tmux config, project-local state, AI panes, MCP proxy processes, and container recreation. Related decision: DEC-20260507_1447-VastLeaf-remove-zellij-and-rebuild-aibox-runtime.'
