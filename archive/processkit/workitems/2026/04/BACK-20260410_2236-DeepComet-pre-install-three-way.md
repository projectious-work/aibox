  title: Pre-install three-way diff to prevent edit-clobbering on version upgrade
  state: backlog
  type: task
  priority: medium
  description: 'The diff in `cmd_sync` runs AFTER `install_content_source` overwrites live files, so user edits to skills/processes/AGENTS.md are silently overwritten when crossing a processkit version boundary. Fix: run the diff BEFORE the install (or keep the OLD templates mirror around during the transition), generate migration documents for any conflicts, then run the install for non-conflicted files only. Touches `content_init`, `content_diff`, `cmd_sync`. Affects all install paths, not just templated files. Deferred to v0.17+ as it touches the core install/diff ordering. Old ID: BACK-120.'
