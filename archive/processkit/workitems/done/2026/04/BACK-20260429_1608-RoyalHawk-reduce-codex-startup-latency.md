  title: Reduce Codex startup latency from eager processkit MCP server initialization
  state: done
  type: bug
  priority: high
  description: 'Codex CLI 0.125.0 eagerly initializes every enabled stdio MCP server at session and subagent startup. aibox currently registers each processkit MCP server as a separate `uv run context/skills/processkit/<skill>/mcp/server.py` process in `.codex/config.toml`, so a fresh or cold-cache derived project can spend minutes at `Starting MCP servers`, often displaying the last pending server such as `processkit-index-management`. Direct `uv run` of index-management exits quickly when stdin closes; current warm-cache `codex debug prompt-input` took ~3.9s, while logs show 19 ListToolsRequest handshakes and earlier cold-cache launches downloaded dependencies repeatedly. Investigate and implement a provider-neutral mitigation: preferably a processkit aggregate MCP server/proxy or aibox-generated Codex MCP profile that avoids eager loading all per-skill servers while preserving tool access.'

## Transition note (2026-05-10T03:27:15+00:00)

Implemented and merged in commit 2837ca5 + merge 9a35160. New McpGatewayMode::Aggregate (cli/src/config.rs) wired through mcp_registration.rs/doctor.rs/generate.rs/container.rs; collapses N stdio MCP handshakes to 1 via processkit's aggregate-mcp skill. 233 tests pass. Three follow-ups filed: lazy-import (DaringAsh), upstream processkit issue (CuriousTrout note + agent dispatched).
