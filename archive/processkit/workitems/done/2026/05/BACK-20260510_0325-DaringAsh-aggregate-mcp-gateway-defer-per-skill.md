## Transition note (2026-05-10T11:24:04+00:00)

Implemented and merged in commit 7cae4d9 + merge 6bb317b. New McpGatewayMode::LazyAggregate variant in cli/src/config.rs; lazy_aggregate_mcp_spec() helper in cli/src/mcp_registration.rs emits PROCESSKIT_MCP_MODE=lazy_catalog. Auto chain unchanged (opt-in only). Companion to upstream processkit#31. 904 tests pass.
