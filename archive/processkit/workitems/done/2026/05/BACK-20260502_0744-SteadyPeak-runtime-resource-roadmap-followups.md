## Transition note (2026-05-02T07:44:33+00:00)

Starting implementation of all unblocked follow-up items with at most two parallel agents.


## Transition note (2026-05-02T08:03:11+00:00)

Implemented non-processkit-dependent follow-ups: runtime status line, doctor thresholds, optional audio/preview tooling, docs, tests, and generated-file refresh. Full cargo test and clippy passed.


## Transition note (2026-05-02T08:03:14+00:00)

Validated with cargo test --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml, cargo clippy --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings, git diff --check, aibox apply --no-container, and runtime resource/status smoke checks. No open migrations were reported by apply.
