## Transition note (2026-05-02T08:29:39+00:00)

Starting implementation of accepted plan with max two parallel agents: compose init/reaper plus Codex bubblewrap verification guardrails.


## Transition note (2026-05-02T08:35:27+00:00)

Implemented compose init reaper, generated compose refresh, Codex sandbox doctor guardrails, docs, and tests. Validation: full cargo test, clippy, diff check, apply --no-container.


## Transition note (2026-05-02T08:35:30+00:00)

Completed. Existing zombie bwrap processes still require container recreation because zombies cannot be killed directly once reparented to the old sleep PID 1.
