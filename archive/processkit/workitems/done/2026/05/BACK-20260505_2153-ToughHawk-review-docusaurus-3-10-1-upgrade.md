## Transition note (2026-05-09T22:31:54+00:00)

Bumping global Docusaurus pin from 3.8 to 3.10.1 on branch v0.25.7/toughhawk-docusaurus-310.


## Transition note (2026-05-09T22:32:05+00:00)

Bumped global Docusaurus pin from 3.8 to 3.10.1. Decision: ship the bump. The 3.8 hold was a guard against the 3.9.2 ProgressPlugin regression; docs-site/package.json had already moved to 3.9.2, confirming that blocker is resolved. 3.10.1 is a stable minor in the same 3.x line. Committed on branch v0.25.7/toughhawk-docusaurus-310 (commit d8ed753). EagerDew unaffected — it installs from docs-site/package.json, not the container global install.


## Transition note (2026-05-10T03:24:51+00:00)

Implemented and merged in commit d8ed753 + merge c03d287. Bumped Docusaurus pin 3.8 → 3.10.1 in aibox.toml + addons/docs/docs-docusaurus.yaml. EagerDew compatibility verified.
