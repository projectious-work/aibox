  description: Release-check-state for aibox v0.24.0 reported the pinned uv image selector at ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.11.10 while 0.11.11 is available. Deferred from v0.24.0 to keep this release focused on runtime TUI stability. Before shipping, review uv 0.11.11 release notes, update the pinned image selector if appropriate, rebuild generated devcontainers/base image surfaces, and run the runtime smoke plus CLI validation suite.

## Transition note (2026-05-09T22:33:38+00:00)

Applied: bumped uv 0.11.10 → 0.11.11 across base image, addon registry, dogfood aibox.toml, tests, and docs. Commit 7a26c5e on worktree branch.


## Transition note (2026-05-10T03:25:04+00:00)

Superseded by BACK-SureSeal (commit 0b31a2d, merge a9cbc00). Same uv 0.11.10 → 0.11.11 bump now in main; SureSeal also touched scripts/release-check-state.sh, which BraveFalcon missed.
