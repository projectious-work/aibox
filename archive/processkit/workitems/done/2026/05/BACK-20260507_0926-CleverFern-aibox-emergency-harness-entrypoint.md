  title: Add aibox emergency harness recovery entrypoint
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: Implement aibox emergency <harness> to start/create the main container and exec a plain shell or selected AI harness without Zellij/Yazi/status tooling. It writes/prints an emergency briefing instructing recovery steps around diagnostics snapshots, cgroup pids/memory, Zellij logs, and recent aibox logs.

## Transition note (2026-05-07T09:43:53+00:00)

Implementation completed: aibox emergency <harness> starts only the main container and opens a non-Zellij recovery session with an immediate briefing.


## Transition note (2026-05-07T09:44:03+00:00)

Validation complete: emergency help and invalid harness integration tests pass.


## Transition note (2026-05-07T09:44:18+00:00)

Done for this implementation slice. Emergency path intentionally bypasses diagnostics sidecar and all TUI tooling.
