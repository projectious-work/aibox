  title: Add host-phase runtime smoke tests to release-host
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: Add a release-host regression gate that runs after final container images are built/pushed or at least after the final local image exists. It should create/apply a small generated project against the just-built image and smoke Yazi config parsing, lazygit state-directory startup, Zellij layout/plugin loading, and key/status bar logs. This would have caught the Yazi 26 matcher schema regression and lazygit XDG state regression before publishing.

## Transition note (2026-05-08T10:46:25+00:00)

Implementation started: release-host runtime smoke now defaults to addon tier so git-ui/lazygit are exercised, and tmux persistence defaults are guarded in the probe.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T10:46:29+00:00)

Ready for review: host release smoke already creates/applies a generated project and now defaults to addon tier, covering git-ui/lazygit; docs updated for host-vs-companion boundaries.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T10:46:33+00:00)

Resolved: release-host runtime smoke now exercises addon/lazygit path by default and documents the host-side runtime smoke boundary. Verified shell syntax for release-runtime-smoke.sh and maintain.sh.
