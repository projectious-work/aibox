  title: Improve aibox release script notes and push ordering
  state: done

  priority: medium
  description: During the v0.23.0 release, `./scripts/maintain.sh release 0.23.0` created the GitHub Release with auto-generated commit-list notes before there was a checkpoint to write curated release notes. The release script also pushed the tag before `main` was updated on origin, requiring a manual `git push origin main` after the release. Update the release flow so comprehensive curated notes are prepared before `gh release create`, and so the version-bump commit is pushed to `main` before or atomically with the tag/release creation.

## Transition note (2026-05-10T03:27:22+00:00)

Implemented and merged in commit acf3d00 + merge e437b7a. scripts/maintain.sh::cmd_release now pushes main before tag and adds a notes-curation checkpoint before `gh release create`. Manual shellcheck still recommended pre-next-release.
