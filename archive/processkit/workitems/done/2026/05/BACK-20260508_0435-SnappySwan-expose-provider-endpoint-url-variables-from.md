  title: Expose provider endpoint URL variables from aibox.toml
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: Extend provider/API environment projection so aibox.toml can expose provider endpoint/base URL variables in addition to existing key variables for each supported provider. Preserve provider-neutral naming and generated runtime behavior. Include docs/schema/tests so derived projects get endpoint variables without manual env hacks.

## Transition note (2026-05-08T04:41:30+00:00)

Ready for review: provider endpoint/base URL env metadata, rendered aibox.toml comments, and configuration docs implemented; normal cargo test and clippy passed.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T10:47:23+00:00)

Resolved after review: provider API key and base URL environment hints are present in config serialization, docs, tests, and the root generated config surface.
