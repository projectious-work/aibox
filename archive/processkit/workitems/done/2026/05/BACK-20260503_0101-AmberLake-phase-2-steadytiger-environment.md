## Transition note (2026-05-03T01:01:09+00:00)

Starting phase 2 implementation after phase 1 completion and migration check.


## Transition note (2026-05-03T01:10:46+00:00)

Phase 2 implementation completed locally: profile-aware addon exported surfaces, stable workspace manifest projection, image profile provenance label/checks, docs/tests, and generated project state applied. Validation passed with cargo fmt, clippy -D warnings, full cargo test, and aibox apply --no-container.


## Transition note (2026-05-03T01:10:49+00:00)

Owner-requested phase 2 implementation slice is complete and validated. Remaining warnings are pre-existing context schema noise, mutable latest image pin warning, and live runtime process-count pressure; no pending or in-progress migrations remain.
