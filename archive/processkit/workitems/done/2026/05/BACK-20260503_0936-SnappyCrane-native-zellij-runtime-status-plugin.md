  title: Build native Zellij plugin for aibox runtime status
  state: done
  type: story
  priority: medium
  description: Replace the shell-pane aibox-status workaround with a small native Zellij plugin. The plugin should render grouped runtime status in a visually native status-bar style, support first-class leader-key show/hide without layout churn, and expose compact groups for memory pressure, CPU throttling, container uptime, processkit gateway/granular mode, AI agent process count, disk free space, and on-demand project state such as pending migrations or dirty git state.

## Transition note (2026-05-03T13:12:59+00:00)

Implementation started after owner released the hold. Using the approved three-lane plan with a maximum of three parallel agents.


## Transition note (2026-05-03T13:30:24+00:00)

Native Zellij plugin implementation is code-complete for review: added image-scoped Rust/WASM plugin crate, image build packaging to /usr/local/share/aibox/zellij/aibox-status.wasm, generated layout/keybinding integration for two rows, JSON status backend, docs, and validation commands. Runtime .aibox-home apply reported existing local conflicts, so active mounted runtime files were not overwritten.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T04:28:22+00:00)

Superseded by the accepted tmux runtime direction and two-line tmux-powerkit status implementation (DEC-20260508_0425-BoldTiger-adopt-amended-two-line-tmux-status). No further Zellij status-plugin work is planned for the next patch release.
