  description: 'Release-state check for aibox v0.25.5 reported cargo update --dry-run would update js-sys 0.3.97 -> 0.3.98 and wasm-bindgen crates 0.2.120 -> 0.2.121. Deferred from v0.25.5 because the patch release is scoped to tmux runtime attach/session fixes. Validation required before shipping later: run real cargo update for that set, review lockfile diff, and rerun fmt, clippy, cargo test, and relevant release/E2E gates.'

## Transition note (2026-05-09T22:31:53+00:00)

Applied wasm-bindgen 0.2.120→0.2.121 and js-sys 0.3.97→0.3.98. Branch v0.25.7/tallfrog-wasm-review, commit a8aeb74. cargo check + clippy clean; 851/852 tests pass (1 pre-existing worktree env failure, unrelated to this change).


## Transition note (2026-05-10T03:24:59+00:00)

Superseded by BACK-PluckyEagle (commit 2c1d224, merge 64ffdcb). PluckyEagle covers a superset of the wasm-bindgen + js-sys patches PLUS the lint/fmt fixes TallFrog noted but didn't address.
