  title: Strengthen aibox runtime UI, doctor diagnostics, and E2E coverage
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: 'Approved implementation plan: fix lazygit-disabled Zellij layout leakage, repair/validate native Zellij status line visibility, add pk-doctor checks for runtime template/theme drift and aibox.toml schema mismatches, and strengthen Tier 1/Tier 2/asciinema E2E coverage for scaffolding, updates, migrations, reset, and visual regressions. Implementation should use at most two parallel worker slices: runtime/doctor and E2E/asciinema/reset.'

## Transition note (2026-05-04T09:20:07+00:00)

Implementation started after owner approved the plan. Work split into runtime/doctor and E2E/asciinema/reset lanes.


## Transition note (2026-05-04T10:02:15+00:00)

Implemented remaining interrupted plan: doctor schema and runtime theme/template drift diagnostics, status plugin visibility styling, broader no-container E2E coverage for context preservation and reset-context planning, visual/asciinema lint fixes, and validation across no-container E2E, feature E2E compile/clippy, plugin checks, scripts, and diff whitespace.


## Transition note (2026-05-04T10:02:19+00:00)

Focused and compile-level validation passed. Full live Tier 2/asciinema visual execution was not run because it requires the companion runner/runtime, but the tests compile and the no-container coverage passes.
