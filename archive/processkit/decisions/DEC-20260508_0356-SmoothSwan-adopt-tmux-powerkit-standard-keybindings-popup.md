spec:
  title: Adopt tmux-powerkit standard keybindings popup for in-session key help
  state: accepted
  decision: Use tmux-powerkit's built-in keybindings viewer popup as the default key-help mechanism (on-demand via prefix key), instead of implementing a persistent zellij-style keybar.
  rationale: This follows tmux-powerkit's intended interaction model, avoids custom runtime/UI complexity, and reduces maintenance risk while still giving discoverable key-help.
  consequences: Key help is user-invoked (popup) rather than always visible. If persistent hints are still desired later, implement pane-border hints as additive behavior without replacing the popup standard.
