spec:
  title: Approve held SnappyCrane native Zellij plugin implementation plan
  state: accepted
  decision: Approve the SnappyCrane implementation plan for a native two-row aibox Zellij plugin surface, but hold implementation until the owner explicitly releases the hold.
  context: 'The owner approved the proposed plan for BACK-20260503_0936-SnappyCrane-native-zellij-runtime-status-plugin after migration resolution, then immediately asked to hold implementation while host-side aibox doctor warnings are reviewed. The approved execution model uses a maximum of three parallel lanes: junior-architect for Zellij plugin shape and integration constraints, developer for runtime UI implementation, and junior-developer for focused tests and documentation.'
  rationale: Recording the approved plan keeps the entity layer aligned with the owner-approved direction while preserving the explicit hold. The WorkItem remains in backlog until implementation is authorized.
  alternatives:
  - option: Start implementation immediately after approval
    assessment: Rejected for now because the owner explicitly asked to hold implementation while doctor warnings are reviewed.
  - option: Leave approval only in chat
    assessment: Rejected because processkit compliance requires consequential approvals to be recorded in the entity layer.
  consequences: Do not transition SnappyCrane to in-progress or start implementation during the hold. When the hold is released, record or reference this decision, then transition the workitem and start the capped three-lane implementation flow.
