spec:
  title: Filter aibox log status by runtime session id
  state: accepted
  decision: aibox will create a unique runtime session id for each container start, stamp runtime aibox log entries with that id when available, and make the tmux/aibox-status log counter prefer filtering by the current runtime_session_id with a container-start-time fallback for legacy entries.
  context: The tmux aibox_log segment currently counts entries from .aibox/aibox.log that may come from earlier container builds or runtime sessions. A fixed time window is not precise enough for a per-runtime health indicator.
  rationale: A runtime_session_id is explicit, self-describing, and avoids clock-window ambiguity. It lets the status counter and future log viewers filter the same way while keeping a fallback for old logs and older images.
  consequences: Container startup must write a small runtime-session metadata file. The aibox log schema gains optional runtime_session_id and runtime_started_at fields. Status counting must handle both new session-stamped entries and legacy unstamped entries safely.
