spec:
  title: Use Diagnostics Sidecar as Runtime Status Source
  state: accepted
  decision: aibox will introduce a tightly resource-limited diagnostics sidecar that owns runtime health/status collection for the main container. aibox-status and the Zellij status plugin will become cheap readers/renderers of the latest sidecar snapshot rather than independent collectors.
  context: The 2026-05-07 Zellij native status incident showed that collecting runtime status from the Zellij refresh path via shell helper fanout can create a process storm and make the container nearly non-startable. Host evidence showed PID growth from about 962 to over 10134 within minutes, high CPU, no OOM, and thousands of shell helper processes. The user accepted the sidecar direction and emphasized that the logger must be very resource-limited so logging cannot itself go runaway.
  rationale: A separate sidecar gives postmortem evidence and live status from one bounded collection path, reduces duplication between diagnostics and aibox-status, and keeps Zellij/plugin rendering out of deep /proc and cgroup collection. It also allows independent resource limits and degraded-mode behavior when the main container is under PID pressure.
  alternatives:
  - option: Zellij plugin collects logs and status directly
    reason: Rejected because it keeps deep inspection in the UI/plugin refresh path, depends on Zellij being healthy, and risks making recovery depend on the failing component.
  - option: Keep aibox-status as shell collector
    reason: Rejected because host evidence showed shell fanout from status collection was part of the process amplification pattern.
  - option: Main-container daemon only
    reason: Deferred because a sidecar can be separately constrained and can survive/observe some main-container failure modes more cleanly.
  consequences: The sidecar must have strict CPU, memory, PID, sampling, and disk ring-buffer limits. It should avoid Docker socket access unless explicitly approved, avoid /proc/*/cmdline under pressure, and expose a small latest-snapshot contract consumed by aibox-status and Zellij. Release gates should validate sidecar resource budgets and status degradation behavior.
