spec:
  title: Use harness_order for tmux harness placement semantics
  state: accepted
  decision: aibox will expose [ai].harness_order as the explicit ordering control for tmux layout placement. The terms 1st harness, 2nd harness, and 3rd harness refer to enabled harnesses after applying harness_order; enabled harnesses missing from harness_order are appended in canonical order.
  context: Per-harness [ai.harness.<name>] tables are not ordered because they deserialize into a map. Existing tmux layouts already depend on ordered harness semantics, but the current visible config does not expose a clear ordering field.
  rationale: An explicit order list is clearer than numeric weights for layout placement and preserves per-harness enabled/install/version controls. It creates stable vocabulary for the upcoming layout rework.
  consequences: Config loading must sort the effective enabled harness list by harness_order before layout generation. Documentation/comments and tests should describe 1st/2nd/3rd harness semantics in terms of harness_order.
