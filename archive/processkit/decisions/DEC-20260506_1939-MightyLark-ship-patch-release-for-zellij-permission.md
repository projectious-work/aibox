  title: Ship Patch Release for Zellij Permission Cache Guard
  state: accepted
  decision: Ship a new aibox patch release containing the native Zellij status permission-cache doctor guard, generated-compose E2E coverage, and all unreleased runtime TUI startup hardening already on main after v0.23.20.
  context: The user requested commit, push, and a patch release after the native Zellij status plugin prompted for permissions again. Diagnosis showed the active project had native status mode and seeded permission files, but a stale v0.23.20 generated compose shape omitted the cache mounts, allowing `aibox apply` from an older generator to overwrite the runtime projection without the needed mounts.
  rationale: A patch release is warranted because the failure path affects downstream generated devcontainers, and the new doctor guard catches the specific systemic stale-generator/config projection mismatch before users recreate containers with missing Zellij permission-cache mounts.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep the fix local until a later release
    tradeoff: Would leave downstream users exposed to the same stale generated compose overwrite path.
  - option: Switch the project back to shell status mode
    tradeoff: Would avoid the native plugin prompt but retreat from the intended native status default and fail to address stale generated compose projection.
  consequences: Phase 1 will be performed with the scripted release path. Phase 2 remains host-only via `./scripts/maintain.sh release-host <version>`. The release should mention that the fix detects and prevents native Zellij status permission-cache projection drift rather than only reseeding local files.
