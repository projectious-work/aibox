spec:
  title: Adopt amended two-line tmux status bar layout
  state: accepted
  decision: Use a two-line tmux-powerkit status bar for the tmux runtime. Line 1 is identity, navigation, and project/runtime context. Line 2 is mode, runtime health, and agent/processkit state. Use short word labels such as CPU, MEM, DISK, NET, OOM, PROC, AI, MCP, LOG, and MIG rather than ambiguous symbols. DISK must render used/total, not free-only.
  rationale: The current visible status field is the hostname plugin (house icon plus aibox), which is misleading as a runtime-status indicator. A two-line structure gives room for both navigation and operational health while keeping each row scannable. Short word labels are clearer than font-dependent symbols under load or during incident triage.
  consequences: The hostname presentation should be replaced or demoted to an explicit HOST field. The diagnostics sidecar/aibox-status collector needs additional fields for disk used/total, log severity counts, CPU usage deltas, and compact status rendering. Heavy optional powerkit plugins should remain opt-in or cheap-by-default.
