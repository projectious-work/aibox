spec:
  title: Use native two-row Zellij plugin surface for aibox key hints and runtime status
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Implement the long-term aibox Zellij bottom UI as a native two-row plugin surface: one 1-row key-hint bar and one 1-row runtime status bar. Each row must be independently showable/hidable from aibox leader-key bindings, and hiding a row should reclaim terminal space rather than rendering a blank line.'
  context: The current aibox Zellij layout uses the built-in zellij:status-bar plus a shell-pane aibox-status helper. The built-in keybar is sparse because aibox clears default keybindings and maps most commands behind Ctrl+g via Zellij tmux mode. The owner approved a refined plan for a first-class plugin surface after discussing the limitations of the built-in status/keybar.
  rationale: A native plugin can consume Zellij mode/keybinding state and render grouped hints that match aibox workflows, while a shell-pane status line cannot integrate cleanly with the keybar or avoid layout churn. Two separate rows keep key-hint and runtime concerns visually distinct and allow users to hide either surface when space or concentration matters.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep built-in zellij:status-bar plus shell aibox-status
    assessment: Short-term fallback only. It preserves current behavior but cannot show the full grouped aibox leader map and depends on layout-pane redraw mechanics.
  - option: Use a single combined key/status row
    assessment: Rejected as default target because the combined content is too dense and will degrade quickly on narrower terminals.
  - option: Reconfigure aibox to use only Zellij native modes
    assessment: Useful partial improvement, but it still does not provide the grouped aibox-specific two-row UX or independent show/hide controls.
  consequences: The backlog item should target a Rust/WASM Zellij plugin or plugin pair, seeded into generated layouts, with the shell status helper retained as fallback until plugin behavior is verified. Implementation must include width-aware grouping, no refresh blink, independent leader-key toggles, and documentation of the migration path.
