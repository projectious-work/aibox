spec:
  title: Rename Zellij Status Modes To Sidecar And Disabled
  state: accepted
  decision: Rename user-facing Zellij status mode values from `native | shell | hidden` to `sidecar | shell | disabled`, while keeping legacy aliases for compatibility where practical. Introduce release-runtime-smoke tiers so the default host smoke validates the minimal generated runtime and the full addon-heavy smoke is opt-in.
  context: After replacing Bash status fan-out with a Rust diagnostics sidecar and Rust status reader, `native` no longer describes the user-facing data path. The default Phase 2 smoke was also too expensive because it always installed git-ui and preview addons.
  rationale: '`sidecar` names the runtime-status data contract; `disabled` is clearer than `hidden`; keeping `shell` preserves the fallback status-bar mode. Tiered release smoke preserves confidence while avoiding slow addon installation in the default path.'
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep native and hidden
    reason: Rejected because the terms describe implementation details or UI state less accurately after the sidecar design.
  - option: Always run full smoke with all addons
    reason: Rejected because it makes every Phase 2 release pay for unrelated addon installation and slows the feedback loop.
  consequences: Configuration and CLI help should prefer `sidecar | shell | disabled`. Existing `native` and `hidden` configs should be accepted as legacy aliases during transition. Release smoke defaults to a smaller profile and only runs git-ui/preview/lazygit checks in heavier tiers.
