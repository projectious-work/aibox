  title: Remove Zellij And Rebuild aibox Runtime On tmux
  state: accepted
  decision: aibox will remove Zellij completely from the generated runtime stack and redesign its terminal runtime around tmux as the sole multiplexer. The redesign will integrate a curated tmux baseline, including TPM, tmux-sensible, tmux-powerkit, vim-tmux-navigator, tmux-continuum, tmux-yank, and tmux-resurrect, while preserving aibox's declarative aibox.toml model and downstream reproducibility.
  context: 'The previous backlog item was to evaluate tmux as an alternative or fallback after repeated Zellij runtime incidents, including plugin/server CPU blast radius and status rendering instability. The owner has now made the architecture decision: no fallback evaluation, no partial dual-stack transition as the target state, and no continued Zellij ownership in generated runtimes. This is a major runtime redesign that affects images, generated .aibox-home templates, CLI generation, docs, tests, release notes, and migration behavior for derived projects.'
  rationale: tmux has a simpler and more externally observable status/plugin model for aibox's needs, with a mature plugin ecosystem for sensible defaults, navigation, session persistence, clipboard/yank behavior, and status customization. Removing Zellij rather than carrying both multiplexers reduces runtime complexity, eliminates the Zellij WASM/plugin permission surface, and keeps the generated runtime easier to reason about after several Zellij-specific incidents.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep Zellij default and harden plugin path
    status: rejected
    reason: Recent incidents show Zellij plugin/server blast radius is too large for the default runtime surface, and further hardening would still leave a complex default path.
  - option: Offer tmux as optional fallback while keeping Zellij
    status: rejected
    reason: Dual multiplexer support would increase generator, docs, tests, and support matrix complexity while preserving the unstable Zellij path.
  - option: Disable all multiplexer functionality
    status: rejected
    reason: aibox still needs a reproducible multi-pane AI-ready terminal workspace; tmux provides that with lower runtime risk.
  consequences: This is a breaking/runtime-major change. aibox must remove Zellij binaries, layouts, plugins, permission caches, status WASM artifacts, Zellij docs, and Zellij-specific tests. It must introduce tmux image dependencies, generated tmux config, plugin installation/pinning strategy, runtime startup/attach behavior, status-line design, migrations from Zellij-oriented generated home content, updated E2E/visual smoke coverage, and release notes that tell downstream users how to adapt. The old tmux-evaluation backlog item should be superseded by implementation workitems rather than treated as open research.
