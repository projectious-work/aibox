  title: Adopt grouped aibox configuration schema
  state: accepted
  decision: Group aibox-owned settings under [aibox], container generation/build settings under [container], processkit context settings under [processkit], and AI harness/agent/MCP settings under [ai]. Deprecate processkit package selection in favor of the full product skill set with explicit skill enable/disable catalog semantics.
  context: 'The rendered aibox.toml catalog was useful but exposed old schema boundaries: metadata, image, context, agents, and mcp were separate top-level sections. The owner accepted a cleaner grouped structure and requested implementation plus a patch release.'
  rationale: The grouped schema matches user mental models, makes generated config easier to scan, removes the increasingly stale package abstraction, and harmonizes catalogs around comment/uncomment selection.
  consequences: Legacy keys need backward-compatible aliases and migration. The renderer should emit the new structure, while parser support should continue for old metadata.name, image.version/base, context.packages/schema_version, agents, and mcp during transition.
