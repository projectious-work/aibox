spec:
  title: Approve runtime UI, doctor, and E2E hardening plan
  state: accepted
  decision: Implement the approved plan to fix lazygit-disabled Zellij layout leakage, make Zellij status rendering testable and visible, extend pk-doctor with runtime-template/theme/aibox.toml schema drift checks, and broaden E2E/asciinema tests for scaffolding, updates, migrations, reset, and visual regressions.
  context: The owner reported lazygit tabs opening despite lazygit being disabled, native Zellij status rows rendering as black/blank lines, missing pk-doctor checks for runtime theme/template and aibox.toml schema drift, and insufficient E2E/asciinema coverage for realistic aibox workflows.
  rationale: The existing tests cover some generated files and visual theme colors, but they miss stale runtime sync, status-line content, reset/migration lifecycle drift, and full scaffold-update-reset workflows. The plan preserves aibox.toml as the declarative source and catches regressions through fast hermetic tests plus focused full-container/asciinema tests.
  alternatives:
  - option: Only fix reported bugs
    reason_rejected: Would leave the same regression class uncovered in E2E and doctor diagnostics.
  - option: Only add full-container visual tests
    reason_rejected: Too slow for most regressions and would miss cheap deterministic generation/schema failures.
  consequences: Implementation will add focused product fixes and tests across seed/runtime generation, doctor diagnostics, plugin rendering, E2E reset/migration flows, and visual recordings. Work is split into at most two parallel implementation lanes to keep ownership clear.
