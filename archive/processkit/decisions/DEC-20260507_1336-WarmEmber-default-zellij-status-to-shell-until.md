  title: Default Zellij Status To Shell Until Sidecar CPU Safety Is Proven
  state: accepted
  decision: New and regenerated aibox runtimes should default to `customization.zellij_status.mode = "shell"`. The sidecar-backed WASM Zellij key/status rows remain available as an explicit opt-in mode, but must not be the default again until derived-project CPU stability, permission pre-seeding, and main-container diagnostics correctness are covered by release gates.
  context: A derived project on aibox v0.24.2 showed sustained high CPU with Docker reporting about 386% CPU. Process inspection identified `/usr/local/bin/zellij --server .../aibox` as the owner at about 306% CPU with 31 threads, while Codex, processkit gateway, and the diagnostics sidecar were low. The same project also showed the status row reading sidecar cgroup data (`MEM ~1 MiB/64 MiB`, `PROC 1`) while a direct main-container diagnostic reported `MEM ~679 MiB/unlimited`, `PROC 96`, and the Zellij permission cache was missing. The recurring release pattern is that Zellij plugin regressions affect the whole terminal server rather than just the bar.
  rationale: The Zellij WASM plugin boundary is too high-blast-radius for the default runtime until it has a hard CPU and permission regression gate in a fresh derived project. Shell mode uses Zellij's built-in status bar plus a separate `aibox-status --watch` process, so status rendering failures do not pin the Zellij server itself. This favors runtime survivability over custom UI until the sidecar design is proven.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep sidecar as default and patch individual plugin bugs
    reason_not_chosen: The observed failure pins the Zellij server and has recurred across releases; individual patches have not provided enough confidence.
  - option: Disable all aibox status rows by default
    reason_not_chosen: Too much loss of useful runtime visibility; shell mode keeps visibility with lower blast radius.
  - option: Keep sidecar default only when permission cache exists
    reason_not_chosen: The CPU runaway may involve more than permissions, and diagnostics correctness is also currently wrong.
  consequences: Fresh projects and regenerated layouts avoid the sidecar plugin path by default. Users can still explicitly select `sidecar` for testing. The powerline/tab-bar redesign should build on a safer rendering architecture and must include host/derived-project CPU stability checks before becoming default. Release notes must call this a containment rollback, not a cosmetic preference change.
