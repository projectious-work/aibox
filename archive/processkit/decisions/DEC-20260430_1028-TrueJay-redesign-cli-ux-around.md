  title: Redesign CLI UX around verb-resource grammar
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Pursue a breaking CLI UX redesign centered on a small, predictable verb/resource grammar: init, apply, up, down, get, describe, set, edit, reset, delete, doctor, and self. Keep reset as an explicit scoped verb for project/runtime/theme safety rather than hiding all destructive behavior under delete.'
  context: The current aibox CLI has a strong core workflow but a sprawling top-level command surface and mixed mutation semantics. The owner asked for a radical redesign without backward-compatibility constraints, with consistency and predictability similar to kubectl.
  rationale: A verb/resource grammar reduces command overhead while making new capabilities predictable. Keeping reset scoped preserves important UX clarity for destructive recovery workflows such as project reset while still avoiding ambiguous top-level remove/reset/uninstall overlap.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep current command taxonomy and add aliases only
    status: rejected
    reason: Lower migration cost but does not address top-level command sprawl or inconsistent mutation behavior.
  - option: Use pure kubectl-style delete for all destructive operations
    status: rejected
    reason: Systematic, but loses the user-recognizable reset intent and makes project reset look like ordinary deletion.
  consequences: Requires a breaking release, full docs rewrite, command help redesign, test updates, and migration guidance. Existing command names may be removed or temporarily preserved as hidden aliases depending on release policy.
