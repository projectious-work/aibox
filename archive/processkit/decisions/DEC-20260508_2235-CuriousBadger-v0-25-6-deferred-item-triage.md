  title: "v0.25.6 deferred-item triage \u2014 drop Q2, defer Q3, resolve the rest"
  state: accepted
  decision: "For v0.25.6 cutover: (1) Drop LuckyLily Q2 (skills CLI surface \u2014 `aibox skills add/remove`) entirely. Owner never explicitly approved Q2 and on review does not see the need. Dead \u2014 not deferred, not backlogged. (2) Defer LuckyLily Q3 (further `cli/src/seed.rs` split to clear the <2,400-line acceptance criterion; current 2,929 lines) to v0.25.7. WorkItem BACK-20260508_2234-WiseTulip filed in this same turn. (3) Resolve for v0.25.6 the remaining six items: LuckyLily Q5 (CI release-smoke status diffs), LuckyLily Q7 (skills inline-comment fact-check), BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 6 (Variant 3 Migration emission), Hermes/OpenCode addons checksum gap, AWS GPG keyserver-vs-bundled, Codex seccomp acknowledgement. Each gets investigated and either implemented or formally re-deferred via a fresh DEC."
  context: 'During v0.25.6 cutover review (session of 2026-05-09), the prior session''s handover (commit 4cafa9e) listed several deferred items as "open threads" without filing them as WorkItems. Sources: LuckyLily completion notes (Q2/Q3/Q5/Q7) and prior-session handover open-threads list (BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 6, Hermes/OpenCode checksums, AWS GPG, Codex seccomp). Owner triaged each item explicitly.'
  rationale: "Q2 was a \"nice-to-have\" the previous session bundled into LuckyLily without explicit owner approval. Owner's read: not needed; existing inline-comment toggling is fine. Recording as a \"won't do\" DEC prevents drift. Q3 hit a partial result (3,100+ \u2192 2,929 lines, 537 lines extracted into cli/src/tmux/) but missed <2,400. Reaching it needs a second extraction pass over non-tmux code (banners, runtime-file synthesis) \u2014 independent work, would have churned v0.25.6 mid-flight. The remaining six items are real release-blocking gaps (security hardening, CI gate, schema emission, doc-only fixes) cheaper to land in v0.25.6 than re-explain in v0.25.7."
  alternatives:
  - option: Defer all to v0.25.7 (ship v0.25.6 now)
    rejected_because: Six items include security hardening and a known CI gap; shipping them in v0.25.6 is materially better.
  - option: Backlog Q2 too
    rejected_because: Owner explicitly does not want Q2; tracking invites scope creep.
  consequences: 'Q2 closed; resurrect only on fresh evidence + new DEC. Q3 v0.25.7 backlog filed (compliance: same-turn entity creation). Six items expand this session''s scope into investigate-then-implement-or-redefer dispatch via the team. PluckyThorn stays in `review` until all six resolve AND PROC-release canonical steps (version bump, RELEASE-NOTES, tag, GH release, docs deploy) complete.'
