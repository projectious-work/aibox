  title: "v0.25.6: Yazi 'e' editor handoff hard-cut \u2014 remove persistent vim pane, on-demand popup"
  state: accepted
  decision: For v0.25.6 we eliminate the persistent vim/editor pane from every layout (`dev`, `ai`, `focus`, `cowork`, `cowork-swap`, `browse`). Yazi `e` is rebound to open a full-screen tmux `display-popup -E` running vim on the marked file; `:q` closes the popup and returns focus to yazi. Yazi `Enter` keeps the existing suspending-launcher behavior (vim takes over the yazi pane until `:q`). The 128-line `open-in-editor.sh` discovery machinery (`find_editor_pane`, directional fallback, `vim-loop` detection, send-keys to long-lived vim) is deleted. Owner-approved.
  context: "Owner reports the persistent-vim-pane handoff has been visibly broken in some form across more than 20 aibox releases \u2014 the yazi `e` keybinding loads files into the loop-running vim screen unreliably, with the regression appearing, getting fixed, and re-appearing. The 2026-05-08 cross-cutting review (DEC-20260508_1515-SilentAsh) did not include this scope. Owner now requests a hard cut as part of v0.25.6."
  rationale: "The fragility is structural: reliably reusing a long-lived vim across tmux pane discovery, command sends, and pane-id tracking depends on (a) the pane title staying `editor`/`vim-loop`, (b) vim not being mid-modal-state when `:edit` is sent, (c) the discovery script finding the right pane across layout-specific topologies, (d) tmux send-keys not racing with shell history. Each of these has its own failure mode and they compound. A stateless full-screen popup eliminates the entire surface \u2014 every `e` press starts a fresh vim, no discovery, no send-keys, no shared state. The cost (vim startup latency, no shared register/buffer state across opens) is low for a code/config editing workflow where files are typically opened one at a time. `:q` gracefully closes the popup via `display-popup -E`. Owner explicitly chose this trade-off after living with the recurring regression."
  alternatives:
  - option: Yet another rewrite of the discovery + send-keys logic
    rejected_because: Same architectural pattern; will regress again. Owner has rejected this path after 20+ releases of the cycle.
  - option: Keep persistent vim pane but use tmux pipe-pane with named pipes for file-open command
    rejected_because: Adds a new failure surface (pipe lifecycle, race with vim's own input handling) without removing the old one. Marginal robustness gain.
  - option: Drop the popup approach in favor of a new tmux window per file
    rejected_because: Pollutes the window list; doesn't match owner's spec ('full screen pane on the current screen').
  - option: Make Enter and 'e' identical (both suspend yazi)
    rejected_because: "Owner explicitly wants the two paths to differ \u2014 Enter is the launcher pattern, 'e' is the explicit overlay for marked files. Differentiation has UX value."
  consequences: "POSITIVE:\n- 'e' becomes 100% reliable \u2014 no shared state to break.\n- ~128 lines of `open-in-editor.sh` collapse to ~15.\n- All layouts get simpler (one less pane each); cognitive load and tmux-config size drop.\n- Vim startup overhead per file open is acceptable (modern vim ~50ms cold).\n- Eliminates the pane-discovery code path that has been the source of every yazi/vim regression in this area.\n\nNEGATIVE / RISKS:\n- Vim register/buffer state is no longer shared across files opened with 'e' (each is its own session). For users who relied on this, Enter still gives a single-session experience.\n- Layout regen is a visible change \u2014 release notes must call it out.\n- Existing e2e tests asserting the persistent vim pane will need to be updated/removed.\n"
