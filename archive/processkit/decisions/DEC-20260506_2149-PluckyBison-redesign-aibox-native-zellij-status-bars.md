spec:
  title: Redesign aibox native Zellij status bars to match Zellij visuals
  state: accepted
  decision: Implement the aibox native Zellij key-hint and runtime-status bars as Zellij-style compact mode/key capsules and runtime segments, using the active Zellij palette instead of the previous bracketed custom ticker style.
  context: The user approved the visual redesign proposal after reviewing the current aibox status/key-binding bar behavior and Zellij's native status-bar conventions. The implementation should happen before the next minor release.
  rationale: The status and key-hint rows are part of the terminal workspace chrome and should look like a native Zellij extension. Matching Zellij's visual grammar reduces distraction, improves first-run trust, and avoids the current custom bracketed appearance.
  consequences: The native WASM status plugin rendering will change, while the two-row layout, toggle behavior, and runtime data collection stay intact. Tests should cover width degradation and the new visual grammar before a minor release.
