spec:
  title: Use compose init reaper and preserve unprivileged Codex bubblewrap sandboxing
  state: accepted
  decision: Generated aibox devcontainers will use a real init/reaper for the main service while keeping Codex bubblewrap sandboxing unprivileged by default. Codex-specific broad grants such as privileged mode or SYS_ADMIN remain out of the generated baseline; only targeted project-local fallback guidance may mention seccomp relaxation.
  context: 'The owner accepted the bwrap zombie remediation plan after live evidence showed more than 500 zombie bwrap processes reparented to PID 1, while the generated compose still used bare `sleep infinity` as PID 1. The plan has two tracks: verify Codex bubblewrap prerequisites and improve process runtime reaping.'
  rationale: Zombie bwrap processes are dead children that need a parent reaper; changing Codex sandbox privileges would not solve zombie reaping and would weaken the security model. Compose init support addresses the observed process-count driver directly while preserving aibox.toml as the declarative source of truth.
  alternatives:
  - option: Privileged or SYS_ADMIN devcontainer
    reason: Rejected for generated baseline because it weakens the main development container and is broader than Codex bubblewrap requires.
  - option: Disable Codex bubblewrap
    reason: Rejected because it reduces command sandboxing instead of fixing process reaping.
  - option: Do nothing until processkit gateway
    reason: Rejected because the zombie bwrap issue is independent of MCP process count and can be fixed in aibox now.
  consequences: Freshly generated devcontainers should reap orphaned sandbox helper processes. Existing containers need restart/recreation to clear already accumulated zombies. Runtime diagnostics and docs should distinguish sandbox-prerequisite failures from PID 1 reaping failures.
