spec:
  title: Hard-break CLI UX redesign without legacy aliases
  state: accepted
  decision: Implement the clean-sheet aibox CLI grammar as a hard breaking change with no legacy command aliases or backward-compatibility shim for the old command taxonomy.
  context: After accepting the verb/resource CLI redesign, the owner clarified that they are currently the only user and can handle a full interface break directly.
  rationale: Removing compatibility constraints simplifies implementation, avoids a confusing dual interface, and makes the new command contract easier to validate and document.
  alternatives:
  - option: Keep hidden aliases for one release
    status: rejected
    reason: Unnecessary for a single-user pre-broad-adoption project and would preserve ambiguity in tests/help/diagnostics.
  - option: Deprecate old commands gradually
    status: rejected
    reason: Adds migration overhead without meaningful user benefit at current adoption level.
  consequences: All docs, tests, generated guidance, and diagnostics should move directly to the new command names. Old commands should fail normally through Clap rather than emitting compatibility hints, except where historical context files remain archival.
