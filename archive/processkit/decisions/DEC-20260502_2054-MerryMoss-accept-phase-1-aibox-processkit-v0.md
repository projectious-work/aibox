  title: Accept phase 1 aibox processkit v0.25.0 integration plan
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Phase 1 of the next aibox release will implement the processkit v0.25.0 integration plan: checkpoint the dirty worktree; bump and install processkit v0.25.0; integrate processkit-gateway as a selectable MCP topology; add managed gateway runtime support for stdio, daemon plus stdio proxy, and lazy catalog mode where appropriate; preserve migration safety for demoted legacy primitives; design the optional hard reset path without making it the default; update compatibility docs and examples; validate with unit, integration, Docusaurus, processkit gateway, pk-doctor, cargo test, clippy, and release gates.'
  context: The owner accepted the previously proposed phase 1 plan and requested it be recorded before proposing phase 2. processkit v0.25.0 is available and includes processkit-gateway plus v2 contract changes beyond the original SmoothRiver roadmap. The release target now includes both processkit v0.25.0 integration and later SteadyTiger changes, potentially in two phases.
  rationale: The gateway integration is now concrete and directly addresses the memory/process-count issue that blocked reliable aibox devcontainers. Keeping the hard reset optional preserves the existing migration flow while providing a path for major context refreshes. Separating phase 1 from broader SteadyTiger work reduces release risk while still allowing the next release to include all desired changes if phase 2 is accepted.
  alternatives:
  - option: Implement all processkit v0.25.0 and SteadyTiger work in one unstructured pass
    reason_rejected: Too much coupling and release risk; gateway integration and migration safety need to land cleanly first.
  - option: Release only the processkit version bump without gateway support
    reason_rejected: Would leave the main user-visible benefit of v0.25.0 unused and would not solve eager MCP process pressure.
  - option: Make hard reset the default upgrade path
    reason_rejected: The handover explicitly says the harder reset path should be optional; normal migration remains the default.
  consequences: Implementation starts with processkit v0.25.0 and gateway support. Full SteadyTiger items such as dual image streams, workspace-manifest schema promotion, addon-spec policy enforcement, provider-backend specs, SBOM/provenance, and headless-runner release hardening require a separate phase 2 plan and acceptance. The dirty worktree must be checkpointed before invasive sync or release work.
