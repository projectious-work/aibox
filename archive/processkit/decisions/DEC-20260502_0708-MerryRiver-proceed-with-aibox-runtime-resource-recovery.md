  title: Proceed with aibox runtime/resource recovery plan before processkit-gated roadmap work
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Implement the approved aibox plan in phases: first fix immediate runtime/layout/build/OrbStack/resource issues in aibox, then optionalize selected base tools, then harden preview roadmap deliverables, while leaving canonical Artifact emission and MCP gateway integration gated on processkit delivery.'
  context: The user approved the implementation plan after reports that Codex-only projects can still start Claude due to stale runtime layouts, aibox apply lacks --no-cache, OrbStack groups projects under devcontainer, and running devcontainers have high process/memory pressure. The user also clarified that processkit is already working on the MCP server gateway.
  rationale: The immediate fixes are within aibox's ownership boundary and reduce operational pain now. The largest process-count reduction depends on processkit's gateway work, so aibox should prepare the integration surface but not duplicate gateway semantics. Canonical roadmap Artifact emission remains gated on processkit schemas/kinds.
  alternatives:
  - option: Wait for processkit before changing aibox
    rejected_because: Does not address current broken startup, no-cache, OrbStack, or resource visibility issues.
  - option: Implement an aibox-owned MCP gateway now
    rejected_because: Processkit is already working on the gateway and owns MCP server semantics; duplicating it would create competing implementations.
  - option: Force-overwrite runtime layouts on every up/apply
    rejected_because: Would destroy legitimate user edits under .aibox-home; provenance-based updates preserve the edit-in-place contract.
  consequences: aibox work can proceed without waiting for processkit on runtime provenance, CLI flags, compose identity, zellij lazy startup, and diagnostics. Gateway and canonical Artifact work will remain explicit follow-up work after processkit delivery.
