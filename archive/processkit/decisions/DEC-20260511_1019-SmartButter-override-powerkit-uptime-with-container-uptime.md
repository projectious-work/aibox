spec:
  title: Override PowerKit uptime with container uptime
  state: accepted
  decision: aibox will ship an image-owned PowerKit uptime plugin override that reports container uptime from PID 1 rather than kernel uptime from /proc/uptime.
  context: The upstream tmux-powerkit uptime plugin reads /proc/uptime, which reports host or VM kernel uptime inside containers. In aibox tmux status this is misleading because users expect container uptime.
  rationale: A maintained override in images/base-debian/config/tmux/powerkit-plugins follows the existing aibox PowerKit plugin pattern, keeps the status configuration unchanged, and makes the uptime segment semantically correct for container runtimes.
  consequences: The runtime image will copy aibox's uptime.sh over the upstream tmux-powerkit plugin. Future upstream changes to uptime.sh must be reviewed manually if needed, but the override is explicit and source-owned.
