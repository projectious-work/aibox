spec:
  title: Prioritize Zellij containment, Claude diagnostics, and tmux evaluation after runtime incident
  state: accepted
  decision: Proceed with the Zellij containment patch as the immediate stabilization path, defer the powerline/tabbar redesign to backlog, prioritize Claude Code runtime diagnostics next, and evaluate tmux as a possible aibox runtime multiplexer backend or default if Zellij remains unstable.
  context: On 2026-05-07 a derived aibox runtime showed OrbStack workload above 500% with evidence pointing at the Zellij server process. The sidecar WASM status plugin path also produced incorrect status data by reading the diagnostics sidecar cgroup instead of the main container. Claude Code diagnostics in the same derived project showed MCP auth/install drift and stale generated runtime state.
  rationale: 'The Zellij plugin system has too much blast radius for a default runtime component: a plugin or permission/render loop can pin the whole server. Stabilization must come before visual redesign. Claude Code drift is currently a user-facing setup failure and should be diagnosed/fixed before further UI polish. tmux deserves evaluation because its status line model is external-script based and easier to bound.'
  consequences: Sidecar status remains opt-in until stability gates exist. Powerline visual work remains backlog. The next implementation priority is a doctor/diagnose path for Claude Code and runtime drift, followed by an explicit tmux-vs-Zellij architecture recommendation.
