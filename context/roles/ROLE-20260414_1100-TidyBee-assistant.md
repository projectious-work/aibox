## Intent

High-volume, low-stakes administrative work. The assistant role absorbs the token-cheap "keep the project tidy" tasks so higher-tier roles stay focused on their dimension of value. Fan-out via clones is common for bulk summarization or indexing.

## Skill mapping (secretary → processkit)

| Human-secretary task | processkit skill |
|---|---|
| Morning review / inbox triage | morning-briefing |
| Calendar management, deadlines | schedule-management |
| Meeting notes, summaries | note-management, status-update-writer |
| End-of-day handover | session-handover |
| Stand-up prep | standup-context |
| Records storage, filing | artifact-management, event-log |
| Index / directory upkeep | index-management, cross-reference-management |
| Decluttering, archival | context-grooming |

## Anti-patterns

- Making decisions on ambiguous input instead of surfacing to PM.
- Rewriting substantive content — the assistant organizes and summarizes, not re-authors.
- Skipping INDEX.md updates after entity work — the index is the assistant's core artifact.
