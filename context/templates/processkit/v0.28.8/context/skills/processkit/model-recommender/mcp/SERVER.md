# model-recommender MCP server

Structured query engine for the model roster. Provides capability scoring,
sub-dimension drill-down, comparison, user access configuration, provider-
neutral model-profile expansion, and live provider status checks.

This server documents its own tool contract only. In gateway deployments,
the gateway must expose only the processkit servers present in the
installed/merged MCP configuration; this file is not an aggregate tool
manifest and does not imply every processkit tool is available.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_models(apply_user_filter?)` | List all models with top-level scores; respects user config by default |
| `get_profile(model_id, scope?)` | Full or scoped profile; scope: "summary", "full", "R", "E", "S", "B", "L", "G" |
| `compare_models(model_ids, scope?)` | Side-by-side comparison; scope "top_level" or dimension letter for sub-dim drill-down |
| `query_models(R?, E?, S?, B?, L?, G?, sub_R?, sub_E?, sub_B?, task_class?, lifecycle?, apply_user_filter?, limit?)` | Find models meeting minimum scores, ranked by fit; can rank/filter by lifecycle and task suitability |
| `list_task_classes()` | List fine-grained task classes used for task-suitability routing |
| `get_pricing(model_ids?, sort_by?)` | Per-token pricing + value score (capability per dollar); sort by output cost or value |
| `check_availability(model_ids?)` | Fetch provider status pages; returns operational / degraded / major_outage / unknown |
| `get_config()` | Show current user configuration (access list, governance floor, budget, preferences) |
| `set_config(available_models?, blocked_models?, require_governance_min?, budget_tier?, preferred_providers?, available_providers?)` | Update user configuration |

## Storage

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `context/artifacts/ART-YYYYMMDD_HHMM-ModelSpec-*.md` | Source of truth: `Artifact(kind=model-spec)` roster records with versions, scores, pricing, and metadata |
| `context/artifacts/ART-YYYYMMDD_HHMM-ModelProfile-*.md` | Provider-neutral Role/TeamMember routing profiles that expand to model-spec candidates after runtime access gates |
| `model_scores.json` | Packaged projection/cache and compatibility fallback; also carries shared `_meta` pages |
| `user_config.json` | User's access list, blocked models, governance floor, budget tier, preferred providers, and available providers |

Older installs may still carry `context/models/MODEL-*.md` entity cards.
The server can read those as a compatibility fallback, but v2 does not
treat Model as a first-class processkit primitive.

## Running

```bash
uv run context/skills/model-recommender/mcp/server.py
```

## Key design decisions

**Governance ceiling is enforced by `query_models` and `_apply_user_filter`.**
A model that fails `require_governance_min` is excluded from all query results
even if it scores perfectly on other dimensions. This is intentional.

**`check_availability` is best-effort.** It fetches Atlassian statuspage.io
`/api/v2/status.json` endpoints. Rate limits, quota exhaustion, and subscription
expiry cannot be detected from status pages — those must be checked manually
via the provider's API dashboard.

**`apply_user_filter=False`** bypasses user_config filtering. Use this when you
want to see the full roster regardless of what the user has configured.

**Lifecycle is separate from ranking.** Models remain in the roster while they
are still offered. `active` models route normally, `legacy` models remain
available for price/compatibility niches, `deprecated` models surface
replacement metadata, `retired` models are excluded unless
`include_retired=True`, and `unverified` models follow the same conservative
path as `_estimated` records.

**Task suitability is optional.** `task_class` is a fine-grained routing hint
layered on top of the stable R/E/S/B/L/G scores. Missing suitability means
unknown, not unsuitable, unless callers set `require_task_suitability=True`.

**Role and TeamMember defaults target model profiles.** A persistent identity
or role should bind to `Artifact(kind=model-profile)`, not directly to a
provider/model. Concrete provider/model names belong in `ModelSpec` artifacts
and in the profile candidate list. The resolver filters those candidates
using `user_config.available_providers`, `aibox.toml [ai].model_providers`,
or native harness hints such as `codex -> openai`, `claude -> anthropic`,
and `gemini -> google`. Multi-provider harnesses such as Aider, Continue,
Cursor, OpenCode, and Hermes require explicit provider config from aibox or
the user before processkit can know real access.

**Sub-dimension requirements** in `query_models` are supported for R, E, and B
(the most commonly filtered). S, L, G sub-dims can be filtered post-query using
`get_profile` if needed.

## Adding new models

1. Add or update the relevant timestamped `context/artifacts/ART-YYYYMMDD_HHMM-ModelSpec-*.md`
   model-spec artifact.
2. Score all 6 dimensions and all sub-dimensions.
3. Add `pricing` fields to the version entry.
4. Set `lifecycle` (`active`, `legacy`, `deprecated`, `retired`,
   `unverified`) and source URLs.
5. Add `task_suitability` scores for the classes in
   `_meta.task_suitability_classes` where evidence is strong enough.
6. Refresh any packaged `model_scores.json` projection and bump
   `_meta.validated` to the current quarter.
7. Update `references/model-profiles.md` with the narrative profile.
8. Update the summary table in `SKILL.md` Overview.
9. If the model should participate in role/team routing, add it to the
   relevant `ModelProfile` candidate list rather than changing Role or
   TeamMember bindings directly.
