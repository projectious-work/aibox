# index-management MCP server

SQLite-backed index over all entity files in the project. Provides
query/search/lookup tools used directly by agents and indirectly by other
processkit MCP servers, which refresh the shared index after writing
files.

This server documents its own tool contract only. In gateway deployments,
the gateway must expose only the processkit servers present in the
installed/merged MCP configuration; this file is not an aggregate tool
manifest.

## Tools

| Tool                                                           | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `reindex()`                                                    | Walk `context/`, rebuild the index from scratch  |
| `query_entities(kind?, state?, limit?)`                        | List entities matching filters                   |
| `get_entity(id)`                                               | Fetch one entity by ID                           |
| `search_entities(text, limit?)`                                | FTS5-ranked search with LIKE fallback           |
| `semantic_status()`                                            | Semantic chunk/vector capability and counts      |
| `semantic_search_entities(text, limit?)`                       | sqlite-vec semantic search when available        |
| `hybrid_search_entities(text, limit?)`                         | RRF over FTS5 + semantic results, FTS fallback   |
| `query_events(event_type?, subject?, actor?, limit?)`          | Query the LogEntry events table                  |
| `list_errors(limit?)`                                          | Files that failed to parse during last reindex   |
| `stats()`                                                      | Count of entities/events/errors in the index     |

List/search tools clamp caller-provided limits before querying the
database. Unfiltered event queries are capped more tightly than filtered
event queries, and long event summaries are returned as previews.

## Database

`<project-root>/context/.cache/processkit/index.sqlite` — gitignored,
rebuildable from source files.

## Running

From a processkit checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project   # contains AGENTS.md and context/
uv run /path/to/processkit/src/skills/index-management/mcp/server.py
```

When installed by aibox into a consumer project:

```bash
uv run context/skills/processkit/index-management/mcp/server.py
```

Either form first cold-starts uv (~5–10s), then runs the MCP server on
STDIO. Subsequent runs are near-instant due to uv's environment cache.

## Limitations

- WAL mode enabled (v0.4.0+); concurrent writes still serialize.
- Search uses SQLite FTS5 when available and falls back to
  `LIKE %text%` for invalid FTS syntax or SQLite builds without FTS5.
- Semantic search uses optional sqlite-vec. When sqlite-vec is not
  installed or loadable, `semantic_search_entities` returns no vector
  results and `hybrid_search_entities` falls back to FTS5.
- No incremental indexing — `reindex()` is a full sweep (BACK-006).

## Configuration

Override the database path:

```toml
# processkit.toml
[index]
path = "context/.cache/processkit/index.sqlite"
```

or via env var:

```bash
PROCESSKIT_INDEX_DB=/tmp/test.sqlite uv run .../server.py
```

(env var support lands in v0.3.1)
