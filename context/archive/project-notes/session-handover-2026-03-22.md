# Session Handover — 2026-03-22

## URGENT: Define session handover format

We need a standard handover document format in ./context/ for when sessions are interrupted. This should be part of our process templates — a "session-handover" process that ensures continuity between AI agent sessions. Add to backlog.

## Current State

### Releases shipped this session: v0.3.9 → v0.7.0 (9 releases)

### Post-v0.7.0 commits (not yet released, on main)
- Code review cleanup (-65 lines, shared test helpers, InitParams struct)
- Dockerfile optimization (BuildKit, layer reduction, dracula curl, TeX Live docs)
- Node.js + Go image flavors (10 images total)
- 20 curated skills expanded from 3
- Comprehensive docs review (21 files updated)
- Starship prompt presets (6 presets, theme-aware colors)
- MkDocs removed from python image → 6 docs addon choices
- Zensical migration (config + maintain.sh)
- assist→cowork fix in CLI help

### Stats
- 151 tests, 16 CLI commands, 11 addon bundles, 6 themes, 6 Starship presets
- 10 container image flavors
- 30 GitHub issues (#12-#30)

## Running Agents (likely timed out)
- 4 agents from batch 1 (stuck on web research ~34 min): architecture, infographics, tailwind, latex
- 1 comprehensive skill creation agent (just started, creating 13 skills)

### Skills created so far: 22 SKILL.md files exist
Including: software-architecture (created by stuck agent before timeout)

### Skills still being created by running agent:
refactoring (GoF), infographics, logo-design, excalidraw, tailwind, frontend-design, latex-authoring (comprehensive), kubernetes-basics, dns-networking, ai-fundamentals, data-science, agent-management, rag-expert

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate (before release)
1. Check if skill creation agent completed — if not, create remaining skills manually
2. Update cli/src/context.rs to include_str! all new skills and scaffold them
3. Build, test, verify all 151+ tests pass
4. Commit all pending changes
5. Release as v0.8.0

### Backlog items still open
- Theming screenshots (#14) — needs running containers, visual work
- Security review (#23) — input validation audit
- TeX Live builder deduplication — documented as intentional, but could use shared Dockerfile
- Binary checksum verification — for downloaded binaries in base Dockerfile
- Image signing (cosign)
- Plugin/extension system (#20)
- Zellij plugin integration (#21)

### Architecture items
- Session handover format — DEFINE THIS as a process template
- Skill library expansion phases 3-5 (to reach 75 skills)
- `aibox skill install` command
- SKILL.md security vetting process

## Key Technical Context

### Files modified but not yet released
```
cli/src/config.rs      — StarshipPreset enum, prompt field in AppearanceSection
cli/src/themes.rs      — starship_config() function with 6 presets × 6 themes
cli/src/seed.rs        — starship.toml seeding in seed_root_dir and sync_theme_files
cli/src/cli.rs         — --prompt flag on init, assist→cowork fix
cli/src/container.rs   — InitParams.prompt, serializer prompt comment
cli/src/main.rs        — prompt passed through dispatch
cli/src/context.rs     — 20 skills scaffolding (may need update for new skills)
images/node/Dockerfile — Node.js 22 LTS
images/go/Dockerfile   — Go 1.26.1
images/base/Dockerfile — BuildKit syntax, layer optimization
images/python/Dockerfile — MkDocs removed
All 3 latex Dockerfiles — TeX Live dedup documented, layers merged
docs/**                — comprehensive v0.7.0 update (21 files)
templates/skills/**    — 22+ skills with references/
```

### GHCR
- Public packages = free (confirmed $0.00 actual cost)
- Old versions pruned (kept v0.2.x-v0.3.7 multi-tagged + v0.4.2 + latest)

### Known Issues
- Agents get stuck on web research (WebFetch/WebSearch in background agents)
- Fix: added permissions to ~/.claude/settings.json but worktree agents still have issues
- Workaround: use non-worktree agents, avoid web research in agents, do research in main thread

### Decisions Made (DEC-008 through DEC-011)
- DEC-008: backup/reset standalone
- DEC-009: env switching = plain copy
- DEC-010: context/shared/ for cross-env files
- DEC-011: skills+processes architecture (WHAT vs HOW)
