  title: Adapt aibox + self-hosted devcontainer after processkit v0.8.0 overhaul
  state: cancelled
  type: task
  priority: critical
  description: 'processkit has undergone a major structural overhaul (v0.8.0). Two
    sub-tasks: (a) audit aibox CLI and scaffolding for required adaptations — content
    install pipeline, three-way diff, lock schema, addon/skill references, and any
    processkit API surface changes; (b) migrate this repo''s own devcontainer (.devcontainer/)
    and context/ to the new processkit setup, since both are managed by aibox + processkit.
    Track processkit v0.8.0 changes before actioning either sub-task. Coordinate with
    the pre-install three-way diff work item (BACK-120) which may interact with the
    new install contract. THIS IS THE PRIMARY CURRENT TASK — the processkit reset
    was just performed and aibox CLI needs to be brought into alignment. Old ID: BACK-122.'

## Transition note (2026-04-24T00:20:33+00:00)

Archived as obsolete: This item referenced processkit v0.8.0 overhaul (created 2026-04-10). aibox is now on processkit v0.19.1 with all referenced adaptations already implemented (three-way diff, lock schema, addon/skill references, install pipeline). The underlying work was absorbed into subsequent releases. Marking as cancelled to clean up backlog.
