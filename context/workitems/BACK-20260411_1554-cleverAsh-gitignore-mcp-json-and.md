  title: Gitignore .mcp.json and all generated MCP configs; add [mcp] sections to
    aibox.toml and .aibox-local.toml
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: 'Currently .mcp.json is committed to git. This is architecturally wrong
    because aibox sync will need to merge content from .aibox-local.toml (gitignored)
    into it for personal MCP servers — the same mistake that was fixed for docker-compose.yml
    via .aibox-local.env.


    Fix:

    - Gitignore .mcp.json and all generated MCP client configs (.cursor/mcp.json,
    .gemini/settings.json, etc.) in both the project .gitignore and the scaffolding
    (context.rs)

    - Add [mcp.servers] section to aibox.toml schema for team-shared custom MCP servers

    - Add [mcp.servers] section to .aibox-local.toml schema for personal MCP servers

    - Update aibox sync (mcp_registration.rs) to generate .mcp.json from three sources:
    processkit skills (aibox.lock), aibox.toml [mcp.servers], and .aibox-local.toml
    [mcp.servers]

    - Update ensure_aibox_entries / doctor checks accordingly'

## Transition note (2026-04-11T16:50:09+00:00)

Implemented: ExtraMcpServer + McpSection in config.rs; mcp field in AiboxConfig + AiboxLocalConfig; local_mcp_servers populated at merge time; regenerate_mcp_configs merges processkit + team + personal specs (all in managed set); .mcp.json and all harness configs added to gitignore template, ensure_aibox_entries, check_gitignore_entries, and project .gitignore.

## Transition note (2026-04-18T12:00:00Z) — review -> done

Verified during the aibox#53 implementation session (2026-04-18). The
gitignore entries for `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, and
`.continue/mcpServers/` are present at /workspace/.gitignore lines 17,
18, 21 (with the explanatory comment block at lines 15-16). The
`[mcp.servers]` schema sections in `aibox.toml` / `.aibox-local.toml`
and the three-source merge in `mcp_registration.rs::regenerate_mcp_configs`
are also confirmed present. The aibox#53 fix in v0.18.6 makes this
machinery actually exercise itself for the first time on a real install
(previously the broken walker prevented any merge from happening), so
this WorkItem is now end-to-end validated.
