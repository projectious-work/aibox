  title: Soft reset that rebuilds processes/hooks/skills while preserving content
    entities
  state: backlog
  type: feature
  priority: medium
  description: "## Idea\n\nToday `aibox` offers only a *hard* reset (wipe and re-install\
    \ from\nscratch). We need a complementary **soft reset** that re-synchronises\n\
    the process layer — skills, processes, schemas, state machines, hooks,\nAGENTS.md,\
    \ MCP wiring, compliance rules — without touching project\ncontent that the user\
    \ and agents have accumulated.\n\n## Preserve\n\n- `context/workitems/` (backlog,\
    \ tasks, bugs)\n- `context/decisions/` (decision records)\n- `context/notes/`\
    \ (notes)\n- `context/artifacts/` (artefacts)\n- `context/discussions/` (discussion\
    \ entities)\n- `context/logs/` (event log, session handovers)\n- `context/research/`\
    \ (research)\n- `context/migrations/applied/` and `context/migrations/INDEX.md`\n\
    - Anything custom the user has dropped under `context/` that is not\n  a processkit-installed\
    \ file\n- `.aibox-home/` (runtime seed + agent credentials)\n\n## Rebuild (with\
    \ pre-reset backup)\n\n- `context/skills/**`\n- `context/processes/**`\n- `context/schemas/**`\n\
    - `context/state-machines/**`\n- `context/templates/processkit/**`\n- `context/roles/`,\
    \ `context/actors/`, `context/bindings/` template\n  actors (user clones preserved)\n\
    - `AGENTS.md` and provider pointers (`CLAUDE.md`, …)\n- `.claude/settings.json`,\
    \ `.codex/hooks.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`,\n  `.cursor/rules/processkit-compliance.md`,\
    \ `.aider.conf.yml`\n- `.devcontainer/` generated files (delegates to existing\
    \ sync path)\n\n## Behaviour\n\n- Before overwriting, snapshot the to-be-replaced\
    \ subtree under\n  `context/.backups/<ISO-timestamp>/` so a user can diff / roll\
    \ back.\n- Use the same three-way diff the existing sync uses — but with the\n\
    \  \"take upstream\" resolution strategy on every conflict (no migration\n  doc\
    \ generation).\n- CLI: `aibox reset --soft` (pair with the existing hard reset\
    \ flag).\n- Print a summary of what was overwritten vs kept vs backed up.\n\n\
    ## Why\n\n- Recovering from a corrupted or drifting process layer without\n  losing\
    \ the accumulated body of work.\n- Bringing old projects up to the latest process\
    \ conventions when a\n  full migration path is overkill.\n- Safer onboarding for\
    \ teams who want to realign without paying the\n  cost of a full hard reset.\n\
    \n## Open questions\n\n- How do we detect \"user-authored files under context/\"\
    \ that are not\n  in any processkit manifest (keep them vs. stash them)?\n- Should\
    \ the backup expire automatically after N days?\n- Does this belong in `aibox`\
    \ (container/process layer) or in a\n  processkit skill (because it manipulates\
    \ processkit content)?"
