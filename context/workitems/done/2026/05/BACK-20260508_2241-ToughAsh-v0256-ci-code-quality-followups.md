## Transition note (2026-05-08T23:03:05+00:00)

Starting Q7 (skills inline-comment fact-check pass) via Robin. Q5 dropped per DEC-20260508_2257-SmoothFalcon (no GitHub Actions / CI cost gate). BR-6 deferred to v0.25.7.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T23:11:41+00:00)

All three items resolved.

Q7 (skills inline-comment fact-check): NO-OP. Robin walked all 140 lines in the [skills] block (44 enabled processkit + 96 disabled non-processkit). Compared each `# <category>; <description>` against the `description:` field of the matching SKILL.md. Result: **0 drifted**. Every inline comment is either an exact match or a faithful prefix-truncation of the SKILL.md description. aibox.toml unchanged (555 lines before/after).

Notable side-finding from Q7 (not in scope, flagged for awareness): the 96 disabled non-processkit skills exist only in `context/templates/processkit/v0.25.6/` upstream mirror — they are not in the active `context/skills/` catalog. Working as designed (they get copied on enable + apply), but if Q7 were extended to "verify install-state consistency" it would warrant attention. Out of scope for v0.25.6.

Q5 (release-smoke status diffs in CI): DROPPED architecturally per DEC-20260508_2257-SmoothFalcon-no-github-actions-ci-for-aibox (cost gate; project does not adopt paid CI; release verification stays in scripts + e2e companion).

BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 6 (Variant 3 Migration emission): DEFERRED to v0.25.7. Tracked at BACK-20260508_2303-GentleFern-br-cleanup-item-6-variant-3 with full spec recovery + implementation plan.

Ready for owner review.
