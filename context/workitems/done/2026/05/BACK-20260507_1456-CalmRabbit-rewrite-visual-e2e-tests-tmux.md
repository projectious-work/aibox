  title: Rewrite runtime and visual E2E tests for tmux while preserving test intent
  state: done
  type: task
  priority: high
  description: 'Keep the sidecar container and visual testing paradigm, but discard
    current Zellij-shaped test implementations. Preserve the intent of each visual/runtime
    test, then reimplement from scratch against tmux sessions, panes, status rendering,
    Yazi/Vim workflows, clipboard behavior, and no-Zellij negative assertions. Related
    decision: DEC-20260507_1447-VastLeaf-remove-zellij-and-rebuild-aibox-runtime.'

## Transition note (2026-05-07T14:57:31+00:00)

Worker 2 started runtime/visual test rewrite in forked workspace; scope limited to cli/tests/e2e visual/runtime surfaces and related helpers.


## Transition note (2026-05-07T15:08:48+00:00)

Worker 2 completed scoped tmux rewrite of runtime/visual E2E tests and helper deployment. Owner constraint applied: tests no longer assume tmux-resurrect or tmux-continuum are active by default. Validation: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --features e2e --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --features e2e --no-run. Live companion scenarios were not executed because production tmux runtime changes are concurrent/in flight.

Closed from the stale review queue by owner direction on 2026-08-21; subsequent v0.x releases supersede this historical review item.
