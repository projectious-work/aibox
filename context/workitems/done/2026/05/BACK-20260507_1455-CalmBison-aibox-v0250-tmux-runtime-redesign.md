  state: done
  type: epic

  description: 'Replace Zellij completely with tmux for aibox v0.25.0. Remove Zellij
    binaries, KDL layouts/themes, WASM plugin status rows, permission caches, terminal
    profiles, docs, and tests. Introduce pinned preinstalled tmux plugins and tmux-native
    generated runtime config while preserving the sidecar container and visual testing
    paradigm. Related decision: DEC-20260507_1447-VastLeaf-remove-zellij-and-rebuild-aibox-runtime.'

## Transition note (2026-05-07T14:56:15+00:00)

Owner approved implementation for target v0.25.0.


## Transition note (2026-05-08T10:47:49+00:00)

Resolved from active implementation into review: core tmux runtime migration, config generation, runtime seed, status, docs/scripts/smoke, keybinding popup, provider endpoint variables, Yazi/Vim handoff fixes, and host-smoke guardrails are implemented. Remaining follow-ups are explicit separate backlog/review items: live visual companion execution after companion rebuild, persistence enablement policy, and deferred dependency update passes.
