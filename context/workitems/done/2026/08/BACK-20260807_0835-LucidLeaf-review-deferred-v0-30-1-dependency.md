  description: 'Security review completed for the curated addon catalog. pnpm 11.20.0
    and Tau 0.3.7 were implemented and merged in PR #349 for v0.30.1. Remaining routine,
    non-security updates to assess separately: Zensical 0.0.53 and the resolvable
    Cargo.lock updates (aho-corasick, android_system_properties, clap family, libredox,
    minijinja, regex-automata). fzf 0.74.2 and uv 0.12.2 were also reviewed and deferred
    because their release notes showed bugfix/performance changes rather than security
    fixes.'
