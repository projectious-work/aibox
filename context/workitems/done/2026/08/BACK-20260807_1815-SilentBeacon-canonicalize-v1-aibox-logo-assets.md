  title: Make the v1 aibox logo the cross-line canonical asset source
  state: cancelled
  type: task
  priority: medium
  description: The v0.x assets/logo bundle still contains the older terminal/spark
    mark while the v1.x documentation workstream contains the owner-preferred hexagonal
    AI-box mark. Promote the approved v1 mark into the canonical cross-line asset
    bundle, regenerate every SVG/ICO/PNG/touch-icon variant from that source, align
    v0.x and v1.x documentation consumers, and add a check that prevents navbar/favicon
    assets from drifting across maintained lines.
