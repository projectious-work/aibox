## Transition note (2026-07-28T07:05:24+00:00)

Starting v0.28.17 diagnosis, add-on-wide audit, durable fix, regression coverage, and release preparation.


## Transition note (2026-07-28T09:02:30+00:00)

v0.28.17 Phase 1 published from v0.x-release with Linux binaries, checksum sidecars, and docs after all local, audit, cross-build, and Tier 2 gates passed. Host-only release-host 0.28.17 remains for macOS assets, GHCR images, and generated runtime refresh.


## Transition note (2026-07-28T09:11:06+00:00)

Verified v0.28.17 host Phase 2: both macOS archives and checksum sidecars are published; GHCR base-debian foundation/runtime version tags return HTTP 200; runtime-latest matches the v0.28.17 runtime digest; generated-runtime PR #234 is merged; v0.x-release is synchronized.
