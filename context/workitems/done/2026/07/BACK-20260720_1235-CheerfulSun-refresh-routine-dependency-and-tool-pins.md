  title: Refresh routine dependency and tool pins after v0.28.1
  state: cancelled
  type: task
  priority: medium
  description: Follow up on the v0.28.1 release-state report. Review and update routine
    non-security drift in base-image tools (ripgrep, eza, fzf, uv), documentation
    and language addon pins, infrastructure tools, Hermes Agent, and Cargo.lock-resolvable
    Rust dependencies. Review upstream release notes and rerun the full release validation
    surface. Cargo audit was clean and processkit v0.27.4 was current at release time.
