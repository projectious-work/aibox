  title: Fix Kubernetes addon checksum verification and release v0.28.6
  state: in-progress
  type: bug
  priority: high
  description: Repair derived-project container builds where Helm checksum files name
    the upstream archive but aibox downloads to /tmp/helm.tar.gz. Make checksum verification
    path-safe for Helm, Kustomize, and k9s; add regression coverage; port applicable
    changes across v0.x and v1.x; publish v0.28.6 and verify release artifacts.

## Transition note (2026-07-23T15:38:21+00:00)

Confirmed the upstream checksum filename mismatch and began generator/test remediation on v0.x before porting to v1.x.
