  summary: Classifier logic at content_diff.rs:144 looks correct in isolation; false
    positives must come from upstream parameter computation, not the match arms themselves.

    match_logic: cache_eq = (reference == cache); live_eq = live==reference; (false,true)
      -> ChangedUpstreamOnly; (false,false) -> Conflict
    expected_for_canonical_no_conflict: live==old_mirror, upstream changed -> cache_eq=false,
      live_eq=true -> ChangedUpstreamOnly (correct)
    v0.21.0_fix: commit b1b57cf tightened RemovedUpstreamStale reclassification pass
      (lines 326-349) to compare live_sha vs older-mirror SHA before reclassifying.
      The classify() function itself was not changed.

    open_question: 'If classify() is correct, why did v0.22.0->v0.23.0 produce 50
      false-positive Conflicts on files where the user did not edit? Three hypotheses:
      (1) rendered-template SHA drift between mirror-render and live-install-render
      breaks the DEC-034 invariant; (2) wrong arg order at the call site (something
      other than old_mirror passed as `reference`); (3) live_sha computation includes
      line-ending or trailing-newline normalization that the mirror SHA does not.'
    next_step: 'Reproduce a single false-positive: pick one file, capture the three
      SHAs actually passed to classify() at runtime, and trace which hypothesis matches.'
