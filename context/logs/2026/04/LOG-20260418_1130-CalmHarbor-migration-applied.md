    conflicts_decision: |
      All 8 conflicts resolved as no-ops. The 4 skill-gate scripts were pre-patched in the
      prior session (LOG-20260418_0900) as the hookEventName intermediate hotfix and now
      match v0.18.1 byte-for-byte. Schemas and skills/INDEX.md were already at v0.18.1.
      AGENTS.md keeps local v2 compliance markers — upstream still ships v1 markers, this
      gap is a known upstream inconsistency tracked by processkit (handover open_thread #3).
