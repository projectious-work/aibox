# General Work Instructions

Machine-managed by dev-box. These rules apply to all AI agents working in this repo.

## Critical Architectural Distinction

**We are in a dev-container building dev-containers.**

This repo has TWO separate sets of container definitions:

- **`.devcontainer/`** — THIS project's own dev environment (Rust toolchain, Python/uv/MkDocs). What VS Code and `scripts/dev.sh` use.
- **`images/`** — Published images that OTHER projects consume (pushed to GHCR). They do NOT include Rust toolchain or MkDocs.

Never confuse these two. Changes to `.devcontainer/` affect our development. Changes to `images/` affect downstream projects.

## Communication

- Be concise and direct
- Always reference GitHub issue numbers in commits (fixes #N, refs #N)
- No trailing summaries after completing work

## Code Quality

- Zero clippy warnings with `-D warnings`
- All tests must pass before committing
- Run `cargo test` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before commits

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:)
- Never force-push to main
- Include Cargo.lock in version bump commits

## Known Issues and Gotchas

- **Podman compose** output format varies by version; always use `inspect`
- **Stale image cache**: rebuild with `--no-cache` if container exits immediately
- **`.dev-box-home/` must be in `.gitignore`** — contains SSH keys and personal config
- **Zellij pinned to 0.43.1**: change `ARG ZELLIJ_VERSION` to upgrade
- **`host.docker.internal`**: works on Docker Desktop and Podman pasta; bare Linux Docker may need `--add-host`
- **OrbStack virtiofs**: files mounted from macOS may lose execute permissions. Workaround: `chmod +x` inside container.
- **Claude Code OAuth in containers**: use `claude setup-token` or authenticate on host (credentials shared via `.claude` mount). See [anthropics/claude-code#14528](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14528). Do NOT use `network_mode: host`.
