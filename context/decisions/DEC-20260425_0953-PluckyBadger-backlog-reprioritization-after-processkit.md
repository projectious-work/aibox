  title: Backlog reprioritization after processkit v0.19.1 upgrade (2026-04-25)
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Establish 90-day focus on 5 items; defer remaining 37 to next planning
    cycle. Focus order: (1) Security review (JollyWren), (2) Pre-install three-way
    diff (DeepComet), (3) Version upgrade flows (LoyalSeal), (4) Preview companion
    design (CoolBear), (5) Process model retrospective (AmberWren) — parallel with
    above.'
  context: 'Audit of 42 backlog items post-v0.19.1 completed. HIGH priority items
    all confirmed Active. MEDIUM items split: 5 Active (unblocking), 18 Defer (90-day
    candidates), 4 Discuss (need owner input). LOW items: 9 Defer (6-12 month horizon),
    2 Obsolete (remove). No circular dependencies found. Critical path: security →
    pre-install → version-upgrade-flows.'
  rationale: Security review is foundational; must complete before finalizing any
    version-upgrade command. Pre-install three-way diff is a prerequisite for safe
    migrations. Version-upgrade flows design builds on both. Preview companion and
    process retrospective are high-value but don't block other work; can proceed in
    parallel. Deferring 37 items reduces cognitive load and allows focus on critical
    architectural work. Repository health is good (0 errors from pk-doctor); no urgent
    production fixes needed.
