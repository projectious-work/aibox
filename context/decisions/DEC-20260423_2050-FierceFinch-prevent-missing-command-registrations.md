spec:
  title: Prevent missing command registrations in derived projects
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Implement three-part fix: (1) upstream processkit v0.19.2+ ships skills
    with complete command directories; (2) extend aibox doctor to validate all installed
    skills have CLI command registration; (3) aibox sync auto-generates missing command
    files from SKILL.md definitions as safeguard.'
  context: pk-doctor was shipped in processkit v0.19.1 without its commands/ directory,
    making /pk-doctor unavailable in Claude Code until manually copied. This will
    affect any derived project that uses v0.19.1. The issue should not recur.
  rationale: 'Layered defense: upstream prevents the problem, detection catches it
    if it happens, auto-remediation makes it transparent to users. Three layers because
    processkit release cycles are independent of aibox, so detection + remediation
    protect derived projects until processkit ships a fix.'
  alternatives:
  - option: Ignore
    rationale: Let users discover missing commands (too costly, each new project wastes
      time)
  - option: Only upstream fix
    rationale: Only fix in processkit (slow — derived projects stuck until new release)
  - option: Only detection
    rationale: Only add doctor check (reactionary — users see errors but have no fix)
