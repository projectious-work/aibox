  title: MCP skill-name collision guard — warn-and-continue, keep bare-name keys
  state: accepted
  decision: The MCP/commands walkers (cli/src/mcp_registration.rs::collect_processkit_mcp_specs
    and cli/src/claude_commands.rs::collect_live_commands) continue to key on the
    bare skill directory name (e.g. `skill-gate`). A collision guard emits `output::warn(...)`
    with both category paths when a duplicate basename is encountered; first-wins
    is deterministic. No hard fail, no rekeying to `<category>/<skill>`.
  context: During aibox#53 (per-skill MCP config merge), both walkers were identified
    as vulnerable to a silent last-wins overwrite if a future processkit catalog ever
    shipped two skills with the same basename in different categories. The current
    catalog has no collisions, so the risk is prospective. Q2 of the aibox#53 architect's
    plan flagged this; on 2026-04-18 the project owner approved the guard scope.
  rationale: Existing installs must not break on sync, so hard-fail is too aggressive.
    Rekeying to the fully-qualified `<category>/<skill>` form would be a breaking
    change to downstream MCP config consumers. A warn-and-continue guard with deterministic
    first-wins semantics catches the failure mode without cost — operators get enough
    information (both colliding paths) to disambiguate upstream.
  alternatives:
  - option: Hard-fail on collision
    why_not: Breaks existing installs on any upstream regression; sync becomes brittle.
  - option: Rekey to <category>/<skill>
    why_not: Breaking change for every MCP config consumer; unnecessary for a prospective
      problem.
  - option: Silent last-wins (status quo pre-guard)
    why_not: No operator signal when it happens; debugging a missing tool surface
      would be painful.
  consequences: If upstream processkit ever ships two same-basename skills in different
    categories, sync emits a warning and deterministically keeps the first-seen entry.
    Operators see both paths and can rename upstream or override locally. No silent
    clobber. If in the future the catalog grows large enough that collisions are likely,
    this decision should be revisited and fully-qualified keys considered.
