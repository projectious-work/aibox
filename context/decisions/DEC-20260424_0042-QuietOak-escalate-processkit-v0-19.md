  title: Escalate processkit v0.19.1 collision issues to upstream
  state: accepted
  decision: 'Report two collision issues discovered during derived project aibox sync
    with processkit v0.19.1: (1) duplicate skill basename ''retrospective'' (product
    vs processkit), (2) duplicate command ''pk-resume.md'' (morning-briefing vs status-briefing).
    Created GitHub issues with processkit project requesting upstream fix and documenting
    workarounds for affected users.'
  context: 'Derived project reported during `aibox sync`: warnings about skill and
    command collisions resolved via last-wins semantics. Silent functionality loss
    for users if they expect the product-team''s retrospective or morning-briefing''s
    pk-resume.'
  rationale: 'These are upstream processkit issues that affect all derived projects
    on v0.19.1. Creating issues with upstream team ensures: (1) visibility of the
    problem, (2) coordinated fix across skill owners, (3) prevention of similar collisions
    in future releases via CI tests, (4) clear guidance for affected users on workarounds/pinning.'
