# Contributing to aibox

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (`rustup`)
- `cargo` on PATH
- The dev container (`.devcontainer/`) is the recommended environment — it includes
  the cross-compiler for x86_64 and all release tooling.

## Build

```bash
cd cli && cargo build           # debug build
cd cli && cargo build --release # release build
```

## Test

```bash
# All tests (unit + integration + E2E tier 1 — no container needed)
cd cli && cargo test

# Lint — zero warnings required
cd cli && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Format check
cd cli && cargo fmt -- --check
```

### Local E2E contracts

```bash
# 1. Build the CLI binary
cd /workspace/cli && cargo build

# 2. Run local E2E contracts. No Docker, SSH, or companion is used.
cd /workspace/cli && cargo test --test e2e

# Run a specific E2E test
cd /workspace/cli && cargo test --test e2e local_lifecycle
```

Real candidate-image lifecycle evidence runs only through the owner-controlled
macOS release host gate. Its core candidate lifecycle, native Darwin smoke,
cleanup, SBOM, and vulnerability checks run for every release. Checksummed
changed-path provenance additionally selects affected download-based addon
builds, the LaTeX watcher/preview lifecycle, and the rootless Podman readiness probe.

### Visual E2E tiers

The generated tmux/Yazi visual tests run real isolated tmux/asciinema sessions
inside the development container. The focused commands remain useful during
development:

```bash
./scripts/maintain.sh test-e2e-visual-status # layouts, themes, tmux status rows
./scripts/maintain.sh test-e2e-visual-tabs   # tab traversal, tools, harnesses
./scripts/maintain.sh test-e2e-visual-yazi   # Yazi previews, git symbols, plugins
./scripts/maintain.sh test-e2e-visual        # all visual tiers
```

The release workflow always runs all three visual tiers plus
`scripts/test-screencasts.sh themes`, which validates every palette using a
test-owned tmux server. `AIBOX_RELEASE_SKIP_VISUAL=1` is an emergency-only
override and emits a prominent warning.

To generate current-release source artifacts for documentation screenshots or
screencasts:

```bash
./scripts/maintain.sh test-e2e-doc-captures
```

Set `AIBOX_E2E_VISUAL_ARTIFACT_DIR` to override the default output directory
(`docs-site/static/img/e2e/`).

## Before committing

```bash
cd cli && cargo test && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Both must be clean. `cargo audit` must also be clean before tagging a release.

Use the repository's canonical Git identity for release and maintenance
commits:

```bash
git config user.name projectious
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```

The reported email must match the canonical maintainer identity configured for
the repository. Do not substitute a harness-generated or container-local
identity in release commits.

## Commit message format

Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`.
Always reference GitHub issue numbers: `fixes #N`, `refs #N`.
Include `Cargo.lock` in version bump commits.

## Release

See `context/notes/NOTE-20260411_0000-LoyalSpruce-aibox-release-process.md` for the full release process.
Quick summary: `./scripts/maintain.sh release X.Y.Z` in the container prepares
an immutable run directory. On macOS, run the single run-directory command
printed in `dist/RELEASE-PROMPT.md`.

Before publication, the release checks also require
`docs-site/content/changelog/release-vX-Y-Z.md` to contain the exact version,
link to its GitHub release tag, and sort as the newest public changelog entry.

To rehearse the complete host validation and evidence path without uploading
artifacts or pushing images, append `--dry-run` to that command. A successful
dry run prints the explicit publisher command for the verified run directory.

The host gate defaults to `--ui=auto`: an interactive terminal receives a
Textual dashboard with a task-count progress bar, persistent task states, and
a bordered selectable log; redirected output retains the plain streaming
renderer. Use `--ui=textual` to require the dashboard or `--ui=plain` for CI,
captured logs, and troubleshooting. Space toggles live-tail, `w` toggles
wrapping, Ctrl+A/C selects and copies log text, `y` copies the selected task
log, End resumes following, and `p` shows the authoritative log path.
Presentation is never release evidence: attach
`evidence/command-results.log` when complete unabridged output is needed.

For a repeated candidate rehearsal, add `--reuse-cache` to permit verified
content-addressed container layers to be reused. The gate still runs every
build command, smoke test, inspection, SBOM generation, vulnerability scan,
and evidence check; the default remains fresh downstream image layers.

Release validation and publication run locally. Do not introduce GitHub Actions
or another hosted CI release path. The local release tooling runs independent
gates concurrently, records exact-commit evidence under `dist/release-evidence/`,
and reuses that evidence only when its source, toolchain, environment scope,
and produced artifact checksums still match.

## Repository layout

| Path | Owns |
|------|------|
| `cli/` | The Rust CLI — the only shipped artifact besides addon YAMLs |
| `addons/` | YAML addon definitions (python, rust, node, latex, …) |
| `images/` | Container image build recipes published to GHCR |
| `docs-site/` | Hugo documentation using the projectious.work brand theme |
| `scripts/` | Release and maintenance tooling |
| `context/` | This project's context (workitems, decisions, notes, …) |

**Key Rust modules:**

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `cli/src/main.rs` | Entry point, tracing setup, dispatch |
| `cli/src/cli.rs` | clap derive-based arg parsing |
| `cli/src/config.rs` | `aibox.toml` deserialization (serde + toml) |
| `cli/src/generate.rs` | Dockerfile / compose / devcontainer.json generation |
| `cli/src/container.rs` | `up` / `down` / runtime lifecycle helpers |
| `cli/src/content_source.rs` | processkit release-asset fetcher with fallback strategies |
| `cli/src/content_install.rs` | Install map — where each processkit file lands |
| `cli/src/content_init.rs` | `install_content_source` orchestration; templates mirror |
| `cli/src/content_diff.rs` | Three-way diff; migration document generation |
| `cli/src/mcp_registration.rs` | Per-harness MCP server registration |
| `cli/src/processkit_vocab.rs` | **Central constants module** — all processkit vocabulary |
| `cli/src/addon_loader.rs` | YAML addon loading and template context building |
| `cli/src/seed.rs` | `.aibox-home/` runtime config seed |
| `cli/src/doctor.rs` | Diagnostic checks |
| `cli/src/runtime_resources.rs` | cgroup/procfs runtime resource snapshots |
| `cli/src/context.rs` | Project skeleton scaffolding, gitignore, provider thin pointers |

**Rule:** Never hardcode processkit path strings, filenames, or vocabulary in production
Rust source — add constants to `processkit_vocab.rs` instead.

## Critical distinction

**We are in a dev-container building dev-containers.**

- **`.devcontainer/`** — THIS project's dev environment (Rust + Python/uv + Hugo and its module toolchain).
- **`images/`** — Published images for OTHER projects (pushed to GHCR).

Never confuse these two. Changes to `.devcontainer/` affect our development.
Changes to `images/` affect downstream projects.
